To \\n\\ncombat the NLF and shore up the regime in the south, the United \\n\\nStates sent advisors, supplies and combat troops. A war escalated \\n\\nthat would see American soldiers engaging NLF insurgents and \\n\\nNorth Vietnamese regular troops in the field.\\n\\nThe supply lines for the war ran south across the demilitarized \\n\\nzone (DMZ) separating North and South Vietnam, or via Laos \\n\\nand Cambodia along the infamous ʻHo Chi Minh Trailʼ. The \\n\\nsource of these supplies was the Peopleʼs Republic of China and \\n\\nthe Soviet Union. The road and rail network of the north was \\n\\nvital for transshipping materiel south. The hub of this network \\n\\nwas the national capital, Hanoi.\\n\\nIn August 1964, the ʻGulf of Tonkin Incidentʼ, a skirmish \\n\\nbetween DRV and US Navy ships, gave the United States a \\n\\npretext to launch air strikes against the North. The objective, \\n\\noutlined by President Lyndon B. Johnson, was to discourage \\n\\nfurther “communist aggression” by launching punitive attacks \\n\\nagainst the DRV.\\n\\nIn late 1964 the Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up a list of targets to \\n\\nbe destroyed as part of a coordinated interdiction air campaign \\n\\nagainst the Northʼs supply network. Bridges, rail yards, docks, \\n\\nbarracks and supply dumps would be targeted. However, \\n\\nPresident Johnson feared that direct intervention by the Chinese \\n\\nor Russians could trigger a world war and refused to authorize \\n\\nan unrestricted bombing campaign. Instead, the attacks would \\n\\nbe limited to targets cleared by the President and his Secretary \\n\\nof Defense, Robert S. McNamara.\\n\\nBeginning in 1965 Rolling Thunder was a sustained bombing \\n\\ncampaign against North Vietnam. Early missions were against \\n\\nthe south of the DRV, where the bulk of ground forces and supply \\n\\ndumps were located. Large-scale air strikes were launched on \\n\\ndepots, bases and supply targets, but the majority of operations \\n\\nwere “armed reconnaissance” missions in which small formations \\n\\nof aircraft patrolled highways and railroads and rivers, attacking \\n\\ntargets of opportunity.\\n\\nAfraid the war might escalate out of hand, Johnson and McNamara \\n\\nmicromanaged the bombing campaign from Washington. Rules of \\n\\nEngagement were imposed to limit civilian casualties or attacks \\n\\non other nationals, such as the Eastern Bloc-crewed supply ships \\n\\nin Haiphong harbor or the Soviet and Chinese advisors helping \\n\\ntrain the Vietnamese military.\\n\\nHowever, the American policy of ʻgraduated responseʼ—slowly \\n\\nramping up pressure on the DRV leadership—meant that more \\n\\ntargets became available to airmen to bomb. The bombing moved \\n\\nprogressively northwards toward Hanoi. Exclusion zones were \\n\\nmaintained around Hanoi and Haiphong to keep bombers away \\n\\nfrom the population centers, but eventually raids would be \\n\\nauthorized even into these sanctuaries.\\n To keep the US Air Force and Navy out of each otherʼs way the \\n\\nDRV was divided into air zones called ʻRoute Packagesʼ (RPs), \\n\\neach assigned to a service. The area around Hanoi included Route \\n\\nPackages 5 and 6a (the USAFʼs responsibility) and 4 and 6b (the \\n\\nUSNʼs). Strikes into RP 6a or 6b were reckoned to be the toughest \\n\\nof all. The Vietnamese, with Soviet and Chinese help, had built \\n\\na formidable air defense system there. Initially this consisted of \\n\\nanti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and MiG fighter jets, but from mid-\\n\\n1965 this was supplemented by surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). \\n\\nA radar net now covered the country that could track incoming \\n\\nUS raids and allocate SAMs or MiGs to attack them.\\n\\nTo survive in this lethal air defense zone the Americans adopted \\n\\nspecial tactics. Large-scale raids were assigned support aircraft \\n\\nto keep the bombers safe. These would include fighters to keep \\n\\nthe MiGs away, jamming aircraft to degrade enemy radars, and \\n\\nʻIron Handʼ fighter-bombers to hunt down SAMs and suppress \\n\\nAAA. New electronics countermeasures devices were hurriedly \\n\\ndeployed to protect aircraft from missile attacks.\\n\\nNorth Vietnam and the Route Packages. The game map area \\n\\nstarts just north of the 20th parallel.\\n\\nBy 1966 the air war in the higher Route Packages was getting \\n\\nhotter. Though most of the casualties came from AAA, there were \\n\\nan increasing number of encounters with SAMs and MiGs. MiGs \\n\\nwere a particular problem because the Americansʼ poor radar \\n\\ncoverage of the Hanoi region allowed obsolete jets such as the \\n\\nMiG-17 to get the jump on them. Airborne Early Warning aircraft \\n\\nhad great trouble detecting MiGs at very low altitude.', '3\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\n\\nMost of the USAF raids against the North came out of bases \\n\\nin Thailand. They would refuel over Laos before flying on to \\n\\ntheir targets. Sometimes the Americans would fly low and use \\n\\nprominent terrain features such as Thud Ridge to mask them from \\n\\nradar as they approached. After attacking the target—usually \\n\\nby dive-bombing—the raid would either head directly back to \\n\\nThailand or exit over the relatively safe waters of the Gulf of \\n\\nTonkin.\\n\\nNavy raids would be launched from TaskForce 77ʼs carriers \\n\\ncruising on Yankee Station. The complement of a carrier air wing \\n\\nwas needed to form an ʻAlpha Strikeʼ. The Navy aircraft would \\n\\nusually take the shortest way into and out from the target.\\n\\nBombing halts became a feature of the war. Some of these were \\n\\npolitically enforced, as President Johnson tried a ʻcarrot and \\n\\nstickʼ approach to coax the DRV into a peace agreement. Others \\n\\nwere the fault of the weather that for six months a year made \\n\\nbombing near impossible. Attempts were made to overcome the \\n\\nweather by developing blind bombing techniques using radar or \\n\\nradio navigation systems, but at best they generated mediocre \\n\\nresults and were often useless.\\n\\n1967 saw Americaʼs most intense and sustained attempt to \\n\\nforce the Vietnamese into peace talks. Almost all the Joint \\n\\nChiefsʼ target list was made available to be attacked, and even \\n\\nairfields—previously off-limits—came in for a pasting. Only \\n\\nthe center of Hanoi (nicknamed ʻDowntownʼ after the Petula \\n\\nClark song) and Haiphong harbor remained safe from harm. \\n\\nThe Vietnamese reacted by becoming more aggressive with their \\n\\nMiGs and using AAA and SAM to rack up an impressive tally \\n\\nof US aircraft.\\n\\nAfter two years of bombardment the Vietnamese were well \\n\\nequipped to handle US raids, having dispersed their supplies \\n\\nand developed the means to repair and rebuild the supply network \\n\\nafter the raids had passed. Their strategy was long-sighted. \\n\\nThey didnʼt have to defeat the Americans, merely absorb the \\n\\npunishment and outlast them.\\n\\nBy 1968 McNamara had become convinced that airpower could \\n\\nnot win the war. In spite of the air campaign the Tet New Year \\n\\nholiday saw Hanoi and the NLF mount an offensive in the \\n\\nsouth. The Tet offensive was a military disaster for the North \\n\\nand their NLF allies, but it still broke the will of the American \\n\\nleadership. Hoping that Hanoi would enter into peace talks, \\n\\nPresident Johnson offered a bombing halt. The communists, \\n\\nlicking their wounds after Tet, agreed to talks and the Rolling \\n\\nThunder campaign came to an end.\\n\\nThe period from 1968 to early 1972 saw little bombing in \\n\\nthe North—mainly reconnaissance flights by the US. Peace \\n\\nnegotiations with the Vietnamese became deadlocked. In 1969 \\n\\nRichard Nixon succeeded President Johnson. Nixon ordered \\n\\nthe withdrawal of troops from the South as part of a scheme to \\n\\ndisengage America from the war. Meanwhile, by diplomacy he \\n\\nwas able to isolate Hanoi from its allies in China and the Soviet \\n\\nUnion. One consequence of this was that Russia delayed the \\n\\ndeployment of modern SA-3 SAM missiles to Vietnam.\\n In March 1972 the DRV launched another great offensive—this \\n\\ntime with a conventional mechanized army. Early gains against \\n\\nthe South Vietnamese were stemmed with the help of air power. \\n\\nIn May Nixon ordered a full-scale offensive against the North—a \\n\\ngloves-off assault from the air. The new campaign was known \\n\\nas Linebacker.\\n\\nThe Linebacker campaign began with the mining of Haiphong \\n\\nharbor, followed by massive air raids against supply and \\n\\ninfrastructure targets. The USAF raids were now bigger than \\n\\never, with huge fleets of support aircraft protecting a handful \\n\\nof bombers. Both Air Force and Navy now had access to a new \\n\\ngeneration of guided ʻsmartʼ munitions that were deadly accurate \\n\\nby comparison with old-style ʻdumbʼ bombs.\\n\\nWith few restraints, the USAF and USN bombed the North at \\n\\nwill. In spite of this, results against the Vietnamese supply system \\n\\nwere disappointing. But battlefield reverses in the war down south \\n\\n(bolstered by massive air power) had worn the communists down \\n\\nto the point where they would accept a ceasefire. In October, \\n\\nNixon ordered Linebacker to end. But, at the last moment the \\n\\nSouth Vietnamese president, Nguyen Van Thieu, sabotaged the \\n\\npeace agreement, hoping it would prevent a final American \\n\\nwithdrawal.\\n\\nIn spite of the bombing halt, the war in the south continued \\n\\nwhile negotiators went around in ever-decreasing circles. \\n\\nFinally, Nixonʼs patience wore out and he ordered a “massive \\n\\nand brutal” series of night attacks on Hanoi, using B-52 heavy \\n\\nbombers. The attacks, titled Linebacker II, went badly at first \\n\\ndue to poor planning and execution. In the first few days B-52 \\n\\ncasualties were so high that the bombers were briefly forced away \\n\\nfrom the Hanoi area and it looked as if the campaign would be \\n\\ndefeated. However, the battle was turned around by the adoption \\n\\nof better planning and tactics. The B-52s became unstoppable. \\n\\nThe Hanoi leadership, sensing they could now do nothing to stop \\n\\nthe bombing, agreed to the October ceasefire terms and to hand \\n\\nover US Prisoners of War. Nixon bullied Thieu into accepting \\n\\nthe terms before halting the bombing. The air campaigns against \\n\\nNorth Vietnam were over.\\n\\nMiG21MF', '4\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\nOrder of Battle Tables\\n\\nFor much of the Rolling Thunder and Linebacker campaigns, the \\n\\nUSAF and US Navy used standardized tactics and formations in \\n\\nraids against targets ʻDowntownʼ. The order of battle tables that \\n\\nfollow depict typical formations. Unless otherwise indicated by \\n\\nScenario Special Rules, players should use the orders of battle \\n\\nshown.\\n\\nHowever, variations on these orders of battle were not uncommon. \\n\\nThe tables list the most common variants, but these are not an \\n\\nexhaustive list of all the permutations. Some campaigns—in \\n\\nparticular Linebacker II—do not employ standard formations. \\n\\nThe orders of battle for these are described in the scenarios.\\n\\nUsing the Order of Battle Tables\\n\\nFlights are listed in the following format: \\n\\n   \\nNumber of Flights times {number of aircraft in each \\n\\nflight} Aircraft Type, Tasking\\n\\nEXAMPLE: a mission is listed as containing 2x {4} F-4C, CAP. \\n\\nThis means the mission contains two flights of F-4C Phantoms, \\n\\nwith four aircraft in each flight. Both flights are tasked with \\n\\nCAP.\\n\\nIf no aircraft type is listed and a task is listed [in square brackets], \\n\\nconsult the order of battle table on how to determine the aircraft \\n\\ntype based on the flightʼs tasking.\\n\\nEXAMPLE: It is an April 1967 raid. On Table A, a USAF \\n\\nMiGCAP mission is listed as 2x {4} [CAP], CAP. This means \\n\\nthe mission comprises two flights, each with four aircraft. The \\n\\naircraft type must be determined by looking at the Aircraft Types \\n\\nsection of the table and following the instructions there. They \\n\\nsay to roll a die. Checking the row for the raid date, it can be \\n\\nseen that a roll of 1-9 will mean both flights are F-4Cs, while a \\n\\nroll of 10 means the flights with be F-104s.\\n\\nOrder of Battle, Table A\\n\\nUSAF Raid, Rolling Thunder 1965-68\\n\\nThe following is a typical order of battle for a clear-weather \\n\\ndaylight raid:\\n\\nPre-raid Forces\\n\\nIf no Pre-raid forces enter the map, the raid begins instead with \\n\\nentry of the main raid force.\\n\\n   \\nJamming Mission\\n\\n   \\n2x {1} [Jamming], Jamming\\n\\n   \\n2x {2} [CAP], CAP\\n\\nIf the US player opts to conduct off-map standoff jamming, the \\n\\njamming flights are replaced with standoff jamming counters on \\n\\na one-for-one basis and the CAP does not enter the map.\\n\\nFrom October 1967 on delete the CAP flight\\ns\\n from the \\n\\nmission.\\n\\n   \\nJamming Mission\\n\\n   \\n3x {1} [Jamming], Jamming\\nTimeline of Major Events\\n\\nAug 64.\\n Gulf of Tonkin incident.

\\n\\nand low, dense cloud of the northwest Monsoon, the USAF was \\n\\nunable to fly visual bombing raids. The Air Force campaign \\n\\nground to a halt at night and in bad weather, so attempts \\n\\nwere made to use blind bombing techniques to attack North \\n\\nVietnam. The following section outlines these blind bombing \\n\\noperations:\\n\\nCommando Nail\\n\\nFrom April 1967, experimental raids were conducted under \\n\\nthe codenames Operation Northscope (April-May 67) and \\n\\nOperation Commando Nail (July-October 67). These were \\n\\nmade by modified F-105Fs with specially trained crews, known \\n\\nas ʻRyanʼs Raidersʼ. Later, (from summer 67 onward, dates are \\n\\nuncertain) F-4Ds would conduct night missions.\\n\\nCommando Nail: Order of Battle\\n\\nRaids at night and/or in poor weather may be designated \\n\\nCommando Nail raids. \\n\\nChoose whether to fly F-105F Ryanʼs Raiders or F-4D in the \\n\\nbombing flight. The raid force comprises a jamming mission \\n\\nand strike mission, with the following units:\\n\\n   \\n1x {2} F-105F or F-4D, Bombing\\n\\n   \\n1x {1} EB-66C, Jamming\\n\\nCommando Nail: Scenario Special Rules\\n\\n1. The bombing flight will bomb using Radar Bombing capability \\n\\n(for F-105s, see USAF ADC note [Q]).\\n\\n2. Because the US raid is so tiny, shift the DRV Detection Level \\n\\nthree columns down for the duration of the raid.\\n\\nCommando Nail Papa\\n\\nCommando Nail Papa was the title for a series of daylight \\n\\nblind bombing missions flown from September-October 1967. \\n\\nThese were flown like regular daylight raids (see Table A) \\n\\nexcept that they were led by F-105F ʻRyanʼs Raidersʼ acting \\n\\nas pathfinders.\\n\\nCommando Nail Papa: Order of Battle\\n\\nUse Table A to generate a daylight USAF raid.

LORAN-equipped F-4Ds would act as pathfinders \\n\\nfor bad-weather raids.\\n\\nIn general, the raids would attempt to bomb conventionally using \\n\\nvisual bombing profiles where the local weather permitted. If \\n\\nthere were no breaks in the cloud to permit visual attacks, the \\n\\npathfinder flights would lead a blind bombing attack.\\n\\nLORAN: Order of Battle\\n\\nRaids in poor weather may be designated LORAN raids. \\n\\nAll LORAN raids add the following to the main raid Strike \\n\\nmission:\\n\\n   \\n1x {4} F-4D, Strike/CAP\\n\\nThis lead flight comprises F-4D aircraft with Radio Navigation \\n\\ncapability (see USAF ADC note [I]) that can act as a pathfinder \\n\\nfor the other Bombing flights in the Strike mission.\\n\\nUse Table D to generate a daylight USAF raid, using the \\n\\nConventional Strike variant. Attach the pathfinder flight to the \\n\\nmain raid Strike mission.\\n\\nIt is recommended that all units in the Strike mission should enter \\n\\nin close formation [see 17.62].\\n\\nAll LORAN raids use conventional bomb ordnance only.

At \\n\\nits core was a group of ʻstrikersʼ—flights of F-105 bombers \\n\\nbunched together and tasked with attacking the target. All other \\n\\nflights fulfilled a support role. Their job was to get the bombers \\n\\nthrough safely. With its emphasis on technology and teamwork, \\n\\nthe strike package was a quintessentially \\nAmerican\\n method of \\n\\nwaging war. \\n\\nStrikes would begin when standoff jamming flights, flying at a \\n\\nsafe distance, positioned themselves to direct jamming down the \\n\\npath of the raid. CAP flights were pure fighters that would act \\n\\nas escorts to the strikers, or sweep ahead of them to clear MiGs \\n\\nout of the way.\\n\\nBringing up the rear were recon aircraft, which would zip through \\n\\nthe combat zone, using high speed to evade MiGs and flak. \\n\\nAs the war lengthened and the DRV defenses improved, the \\n\\nstrike support increased. Extra CAP flights were assigned for \\n\\nprotection, and ʻWild Weaselʼ SEAD aircraft were tasked with \\n\\nhunting down SAM and Fire Can threats. By the end of Rolling \\n\\nThunder the number of support aircraft had increased from one \\n\\nfor every three strikers to almost one-to-one.\\n\\nUSN Alpha Strikes\\n\\nLike the USAF the US Navy operated packages comprised of \\n\\nbombing aircraft and their support. These ʻAlpha Strikesʼ, as \\n\\nthey were known, employed most of the complement of a carrier \\n\\nair wing.\\n All the aircraft in an Alpha Strike would come from the same \\n\\ncarrier, though in the early stages of the war, jamming aircraft \\n\\nwere in short supply and EA-1F jammers would ʻcross-deckʼ \\n\\nfrom carrier-to-carrier as they went on and off the line. Jammers \\n\\nwould also be supplemented by Marine aircraft flying from Da \\n\\nNang.\\n\\nUnlike the Air Force, the USN didnʼt have specialist aircrew \\n\\nflying the SEAD mission. SEAD was just another job naval \\n\\naviators were expected to do. However, the Navy pioneered the \\n\\nuse of new anti-radar weaponry such as the Shrike and Standard \\n\\nARMs.\\n\\nNavy CAP forces operated in two-aircraft flights. These were \\n\\nmore effective than the four-ship USAF CAP flights. The Navy \\n\\nwasnʼt hobbled by the Air Forceʼs obsolete ʻFluid Fourʼ fighter \\n\\ntactics.\\n\\nUSAF in Linebacker\\n\\nBy Linebacker, the USAF strike package had evolved into its \\n\\nultimate form.\\n\\nMore than 65% of raids now used Laser Guided Bombs for \\n\\nprecision strikes against targets. But the Air Force only had a \\n\\nlimited number of Pave Knife laser-designation pods. These \\n\\npods presented a practical limit to the number of strikers that \\n\\ncould attack a target. Pave Knife was such a precious resource \\n\\nthat the USAF was prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to \\n\\nprevent their loss.\\n\\nThe need to protect Pave Knife meant the ratio of support aircraft \\n\\nto strikers soared. The quantity of CAP fighters doubled from \\n\\nits Rolling Thunder peak and SEAD forces were enhanced by \\n\\nteaming F-105 Wild Weasels with F-4E flights in ʻHunter-Killerʼ \\n\\nteams.\\n\\nOne of the biggest innovations was the addition of a group of \\n\\nchaff-laying aircraft. These would fly ahead of the raid and lay \\n\\na corridor of chaff through which the main raid force would \\n\\nfunnel. Chaff corridors proved so effective that losses to SAMs \\n\\ndropped radically and the DRV made special efforts to disrupt \\n\\nthe chaff-laying flights with MiG attacks.\\n\\nThe Linebacker ʻgorilla packagesʼ were so huge that support \\n\\nat times outnumbered the striker aircraft by five or six to one. \\n\\nAllied with the new laser-guided bombs that offered a one-bomb \\n\\none-kill capability this order of battle achieved astonishing \\n\\nresults.\\n\\nEB-66C', '1\\n1\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\nNEW PLAYERS\\n\\nSTART HERE\\n\\nIntroductory Scenario: Surfinʼ \\n\\nBird\\n\\nThis scenario will familiarize you with how to move aircraft \\n\\nand conduct air-to-air combat. It will also introduce you to AAA \\n\\nbarrage, dive bombing, and strafing.\\n\\nIn this scenario the US player controls a flight of A-4Cs while \\n\\nthe DRV player flies a flight of MiG-17F fighters.\\n\\nIt is not necessary to read all of the \\nDowntown\\n rules to play. \\n\\nBegin by reading sections 2.1-2.3 and 2.8-2.9 to familiarize \\n\\nyourself with the game components. Then read sections 4-6 to \\n\\nlearn how to move aircraft. Section 10 addresses the key concept \\n\\nof Detection. Read sections 11 (skipping 11.5) through 13 on air \\n\\ncombat. Finally, read section 20 on Fuel. Those sections and the \\n\\nfollowing rules are enough to get you into the game. Numbers \\n\\nin [brackets] below refer to the relevant sections of the Rule \\n\\nBook for reference.\\n\\nSome of the following rules are cut-down versions of the rules \\n\\nset, so if you have any rules queries that are not answered here, \\n\\nconsult the original rule section.\\n\\nAnti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) [14]\\n\\nAAA Concentrations [14.1].\\n AAA concentrations are ground \\n\\nunits that come in three densities: Light, Medium, and Heavy. \\n\\nSome AAA concentrations have been printed on the map. One \\n\\nadditional Light concentration, represented by a counter, is \\n\\navailable in this scenario. It remains hidden (i.e., not placed \\n\\non the map) until activated, at which point it is revealed. Once \\n\\nrevealed it cannot become hidden again.\\n\\nAAA Activation [14.2].\\n Printed AAA concentrations start \\n\\nthe game active. The inactive (i.e. hidden) concentration may \\n\\nactivate at the beginning of the game or in the Admin Phase of \\n\\nany game turn. Otherwise, it activates the moment a US flight \\n\\nmoves adjacent to it. When it activates place the counter on the \\n\\nmap.\\n\\nFlak Barrage [14.3].\\n Each active AAA concentration projects \\n\\na flak barrage zone into its hex and all adjacent hexes. Roll a \\n\\nbarrage attack on a US or DRV flight immediately each time \\n\\nthe following applies to it, regardless of whether the target is \\n\\ndetected or undetected:\\n\\na.\\nIt enters a hex in a flak barrage zone as a result of movement \\n\\nor scatter.\\n\\nb.\\nIt changes altitude band in a barrage zone as a result of \\n\\nmovement or scatter.\\n\\nc.\\nIt expends an MP turning in a barrage zone.\\n\\nd.\\nIt presses a dive bombing attack.\\n\\ne.\\nIt attacks an enemy flight in a barrage zone (Use the enemy \\n\\nflightʼs hex and altitude to resolve combat).\\n Resolving Flak Barrages [14.31].\\n Roll two dice on the AAA \\n\\nTable using the appropriate column for the AAA density, cross-\\n\\nreferenced with the flightʼs altitude.\\n\\nIf more than one AAA concentration projects barrage into the \\n\\nhex, the DRV player chooses one concentration (only) to roll \\n\\nthe barrage attack.\\n\\nEXAMPLE: A flight moves into the barrage zone of a Light and \\n\\nMedium concentration. One barrage attack is rolled, using the \\n\\nMedium column. The Light concentration does not attack.\\n\\nIf the roll is equal to or greater than the number listed, the target \\n\\nflight is hit. Roll for damage on the Barrage column of the Flak \\n\\nDamage Table. Roll two dice and apply the barrage flak modifiers \\n\\nto obtain the damage result. \\n\\nA ʻDʼ result means one aircraft is damaged; ʻCʼ that an aircraft \\n\\nis crippled, and ʻKʼ that an aircraft is shot down. If more than \\n\\none result is listed, all are applied to the flight.\\n\\nAir-to-Ground Modifiers [14.32]. \\nFlak barrage also applies a \\n\\nmodifier, listed on the AAA table (in parentheses), to bombing \\n\\nattacks in which the bomb run passed through a flak barrage zone. \\n\\nWhere more than one barrage zone affects the attack, apply the \\n\\nlargest negative modifier.\\n\\nMiG/AAA Deconfliction [14.53]. \\nA MiG flight on the deck is \\n\\nimmune to AAA attack unless it enters the flak barrage zone as \\n\\na consequence of scatter.\\n\\nAir-to-Ground Attacks [16-17]\\n\\nThe A-4 flight carries bombs to attack ground targets. In addition, \\n\\nit may make strafing attacks using its guns.\\n\\nThe flight is classed as laden [16.21] until all bombs are \\n\\njettisoned or expended, at which point it becomes clean. A \\n\\nladen flight uses laden Movement Point and Maneuver values. \\n\\nAs soon as it jettisons or expends all its bombs, it uses the \\n\\nclean values [6.2].\\n\\nThe bomb load is expressed as an attack strength, listed on the \\n\\nADC (in this case, 2). When making an attack, the flight may \\n\\nexpend some or all of the attack strength, in increments of whole \\n\\nor half strength points. When it makes an attack, the expended \\n\\npoints are subtracted from the flightʼs strength. A flight may never \\n\\nexceed its current bomb strength in an attack.\\n\\nEXAMPLE: A flight with bomb strength 2 makes an attack. It \\n\\nattacks and uses 1 strength point in the attack. This leaves the \\n\\nflight with 1 point of bomb strength remaining.\\n\\nAttack Procedures [17.1]. \\nThe A-4 flight may attack a located \\n\\nNVA unit during the Movement Phase. It may not attack any \\n\\nother targets.\\n\\nGround targets are rated by their target profile [17.13], which \\n\\nmodifies attacks against them. NVA units are profile D.\\n\\nBomb Runs [17.2]. \\nTo attack by dive bombing, the flight must \\n\\nfirst complete a bomb run. The flight starts its bomb run at an \\n\\nInitial Point (or IP), which can be any hex adjacent to the target. \\n\\nAnnounce the bomb run is starting, then move the flight directly \\n\\ninto the target hex without turning. The flight may (but need not) ', '1\\n2\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\n\\ndive, but cannot climb. When the flight reaches the target hex at \\n\\nthe desired altitude and after all flak attacks have been resolved, \\n\\nthe attack takes place. Once the attack has been executed the \\n\\nflight finishes any remaining movement. \\n\\nThe attacker may announce they are ʻpressingʼ an attack, which \\n\\ngives a bonus attack modifier. However, the defender gets an \\n\\nadditional flak roll just before the attack [14.3].\\n\\nStrafing Attacks are similar to dive bombing, except the flight \\n\\nmust attack on the deck at combat throttle. Strafing flights use a \\n\\nbomb value of 0.5 per aircraft.\\n\\nAfter a strafing attack, roll for depletion as if the flight had just \\n\\nbeen in air-to-air combat (do not modify the roll) [11.33]. A roll \\n\\nof\\n 5\\n or less depletes the A-4C flightʼs guns.\\n\\nResolve Attacks [17.4] as follows:\\n\\n(1) Calculate Attack Column [17.41].\\n  Find the column the flight \\n\\nuses on the Air-To-Ground Attack Table by taking the declared \\n\\nbomb strength expended and multiplying by the number of \\n\\nundamaged aircraft in the flight to find the attack value. Use \\n\\nthe highest numbered column that is equal to or less than the \\n\\nattack value.\\n\\nEXAMPLE: The flight of two A-4Cs attacks an NVA unit, \\n\\ndeclaring 2 points of bomb strength. The attack value is 2 (the \\n\\nbombs) multiplied by 2 (number of undamaged aircraft) for a \\n\\nresult of 4. It uses the 4 column of the attack table.\\n\\n(2) Attack Roll [17.42].\\n Roll two dice and modify the roll \\n\\nas indicated. The flak modifier [14.32] applied to the attack is \\n\\nthe largest one that applied in any hex or altitude band flown \\n\\nthrough on the bomb run. The result is an attack success value \\n\\nfrom 0 to 4.\\n\\n(3) Resolve Damage [18.2]. \\nRoll two dice and cross-reference \\n\\nwith the column of the Damage Table corresponding to the \\n\\nattackʼs success value. The result is listed as follows: \\n\\n   \\nNE: No effect\\n = No effect on target.\\n\\n   \\nS: Slight Damage\\n = NVA unit is suppressed (no effect  in this \\n\\nscenario).\\n\\n   \\nH: Heavy Damage \\n= NVA unit is destroyed.\\n\\n   \\nT: Total Destruction\\n  = NVA unit is destroyed.\\n\\nThatʼs it! Youʼre ready to begin.\\n Surfinʼ Bird Scenario Background\\n\\nThe majority of sorties launched against North Vietnam \\n\\nwere small operations known as ʻroute reconsʼ or ʻarmed \\n\\nreconnaissanceʼ missions. Individual flights would cruise along \\n\\nrailroads, highways or rivers, looking for ʻtradeʼ. They might \\n\\nbe briefed to look out for trucks one day, river ferries the next, \\n\\nor roadside fuel dumps the day after. In essence their job was to \\n\\nfind likely targets and attack them.\\n\\nThis scenario depicts a typical route recon. A pair of A-4s from \\n\\nthe \\nUSS Coral Sea\\n are taking a trip along the coastal highway \\n\\nin October 1966, trying to rustle up some ʻtradeʼ.\\n\\nScenario Instructions\\n\\nThis is a daytime scenario. The target is somewhere on the \\n\\nhighway between hexes 2715 and 3417, inclusive. Whenever the \\n\\nUSN flight moves adjacent to one of the hexes on this highway, \\n\\nroll a die: on a roll of 2 or less, place an NVA Unit in that hex. \\n\\nOnce a hex has been rolled for, do not roll for it again during the \\n\\ngame. Any number of NVA Units may be placed on the map. \\n\\nSet Up. \\nInstead of following the Pre-Raid Sequence of Play \\n\\n[3.1], perform these steps:\\n\\n•\\n \\nDRV: \\nSecretly plot the location of one hidden Light AAA \\n\\nconcentration on the DRV log sheet.

Scenario by Jean Foisy.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nOn 24 July 1965 an F-4C flying CAP was hit and shot down by \\n\\na Russian-supplied S-75 Dvina missile. This was the first attack \\n\\nby SAMs on US aircraft and the shootdown took Washington \\n\\nby surprise. American reconnaissance had been watching \\n\\nconstruction of the SAM sites for some time but President Johnson \\n\\nand Secretary of Defense McNamara were afraid of inflicting \\n\\ncasualties on Soviet advisors at the sites and had determined to \\n\\navoid further escalation. So through the spring and summer of \\n\\n1965 attacks against the sites had been forbidden.\\n\\nNow the SAMs had gone live a reprisal was necessary. On 27 July \\n\\na large raid of F-105s was launched against the sites and nearby \\n\\nbarracks where the SAM crews were living. However, the Thuds \\n\\nran into a flak trap and four were shot down. Two more were lost \\n\\nin a collision on the way home. It was the costliest day of the air \\n\\nwar so far and it was for nothing. The SAM sites turned out to \\n\\nbe cleverly constructed wood and fabric dummies—a spoofing \\n\\ntactic the Vietnamese would become even more proficient at as \\n\\nthe war continued.\\n Targets\\n\\nThe US player secretly rolls a die to determine their target.\\n\\n  \\n Roll\\n  \\nTarget\\n                                           \\nHex\\n      \\nProfile\\n     \\nOrganization\\n\\n    \\n1\\n   \\nLang Son railroad/\\n            \\n0645\\n      \\nA\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n          \\nrailway bridge (1 span)\\n\\n  \\n2-3\\n \\nSAM site\\n                          \\n0940\\n      \\nC\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n    \\n4\\n   \\nPhu Nien barracks\\n            \\n0944\\n      \\nC\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n    \\n5\\n   \\nPhu Tho bridge (1 span)\\n   \\n1041\\n      \\nB\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n  \\n6-7\\n \\nSAM site\\n                          \\n1339\\n      \\nC\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n  \\n8-9\\n \\nSAM site\\n                          \\n1537\\n      \\nC\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n   \\n10\\n  \\nSAM site\\n                          \\n3526\\n      \\nC\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n \\n\\nScenario Conditions\\n\\n•\\n \\nDate:\\n July 1965\\n\\n•\\n \\nTime of Day:\\n Day, 10:30 hrs\\n\\n•\\n \\nDetection Level:\\n US: F; DRV: C\\n\\n•\\n \\nGCI Level: \\n1\\n\\n•\\n \\nWeather:\\n Southwest Monsoon, Clear weather\\n\\n•\\n \\nOpen DRV Airfields:\\n Phuc Yen, 1529 (MiG-17); Kep, 1120 \\n\\n(MiG-17)\\n\\nUS Order of Battle\\n\\nUse Table A for all Air Force raids.

The addition of vital \\n\\nindustrial targets around Hanoi and Haiphong, such as the \\n\\nHaiphong cement plant, forced the Vietnamese to react to the \\n\\nAmerican raids. For the rest of the month the battles were some \\n\\nof the fiercest of the whole Rolling Thunder campaign. MiGs \\n\\nand SAMs were out for vengeance. In April there were some \\n\\nfifty engagements between MiGs and US fighters and a record \\n\\nseventy-two the following month. American reports noted an \\n\\nincrease in the MiG pilotsʼ aggression and proficiency.\\n\\nThrough April and May MiGs constantly attacked US forces. \\n\\nThe DRVʼs practice of “SAM days” and “MiG days” was over. \\n\\nThe North Vietnamese now committed MiGs and SAMs almost \\n\\nsimultaneously against US raids.

Scenario by Jean Foisy.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nBy August 1967 the US Secretary of Defense, Robert S. \\n\\nMcNamara, a once-hawkish advocate of bombing, had become \\n\\nconvinced that the air campaign was failing and the military \\n\\ndidnʼt know how to win. The military leadership, believing \\n\\nMcNamaraʼs defeatist stance would ruin them, rounded on him \\n\\nat John Stennisʼs Senate subcommittee, which was packed with \\n\\nhard-line supporters of the bombing.\\n\\nThe Stennis committeeʼs support for the military forced President \\n\\nJohnson to abandon McNamara and escalate the bombing by \\n\\nopening up a swathe of new targets. Of the 46 additions to the \\n\\nRolling Thunder 57 target list, 30 were highway and railroad \\n\\nbridges. US forces were ordered to sever communications \\n\\nbetween Hanoi and Haiphong and attack bridges in the exclusion \\n\\nzones around the cities. The Paul Doumer highway and railroad \\n\\nbridge had highest priority, as it was a vital link to the dockside \\n\\nwhere East Bloc ships were unloading supplies.

Scenario by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nOctober 1967 proved to be the last extended stretch of clear \\n\\nweather in Rolling Thunder. This was the high water mark of \\n\\nRolling Thunder 57. In recent months many high-value fixed \\n\\ntargets had been authorized by Washington, including the Hanoi \\n\\nbridges. In October they concentrated on the transportation \\n\\nnetwork, in particular the railways between Hanoi and \\n\\nHaiphong.\\n\\nMiGs continued to attack aggressively, prompting Washington \\n\\nto green-light attacks on MiG airfields including, at last, the \\n\\nmain airbase at Phuc Yen. Meanwhile 7th Air Force authorized \\n\\nfighter controllers to use IFF interrogator information, making \\n\\nvectoring against the MiGs more effective. Vietnamese losses \\n\\nwere high, but the MiGs were forcing US strike aircraft to jettison \\n\\ntheir bombs.\\n\\nThe Phuc Yen attack was a joint Air Force and Navy affair, \\n\\nmounted in the face of resistance from a loose alliance of unlikely \\n\\nopponents. General Momyer, commander Seventh Air Force, \\n\\ninsisted the MiGs had been driven from the sky in the spring and \\n\\nthat an attack was unnecessary. The CIA was opposed because of \\n\\nthe 200 Soviet advisors believed to be at the base. Most curious \\n\\nof all was the legendary leader of the 8th TFW, Colonel Robin \\n\\nOlds, who during a visit to the White House on October 2 voiced \\n his opposition to striking the base: “Iʼd rather knock them out of \\n\\nthe skies... Iʼd rather have them come from Phuc Yen, because \\n\\nI know where they are.”\\n\\nTargets\\n\\nThe US player secretly rolls a die to determine their target.\\n\\n  \\nRoll\\n \\n Target\\n                                             \\nHex\\n   \\nProfile\\n  \\nOrganization\\n\\n   \\n1\\n   \\nThai Nguyen rail yard\\n        \\n0728\\n     \\nC\\n     \\nUSAF\\n\\n \\n2-3\\n \\nPhuc Yen airfield runway\\n    \\n1529\\n     \\nB\\n     \\nUSAF or USN\\n\\n         \\nPhuc Yen control tower\\n                     \\nC\\n\\n         \\nPhuc Yen aircraft revetments\\n            \\nB\\n\\n   \\n4\\n   \\nCanal des Rapides bridge\\n   \\n1927\\n     \\nA\\n     \\nUSAF or USN\\n\\n            \\n(2 spans)\\n\\n   \\n5\\n   \\nPaul Doumer bridge\\n           \\n1928\\n     \\nA\\n     \\nUSAF or USN\\n\\n            \\n \\n(6 spans)\\n\\n   \\n6\\n   \\nPaul Doumer bypass\\n \\n         \\n1928\\n     \\nC\\n     \\nUSAF or USN\\n\\n            \\nferry\\n\\n   \\n7\\n   \\nHai Duong bridge \\n              \\n2117\\n     \\nA\\n     \\nUSN\\n\\n            \\n(1 span)\\n\\n   \\n8\\n   \\nHai Duong rail bridge\\n        \\n2217\\n     \\nA\\n     \\nUSN\\n\\n            \\n (1 span)\\n\\n   \\n9\\n   \\nHaiphong shipbuilding\\n       \\n2410\\n     \\nC\\n     \\nUSN\\n\\n            \\n \\nfacilities\\n                             \\n\\n  \\n10\\n  \\nCat Bi airfield runway\\n        \\n2510\\n     \\nB\\n     \\nUSN\\n\\n         \\nCat Bi control tower\\n                         \\nC\\n\\n         \\nCat Bi aircraft revetments\\n                \\nB\\n\\nScenario Conditions\\n\\n•\\n \\nDate:\\n October 1967\\n\\n•\\n \\nTime of Day: \\nDay, 10:30 hrs\\n\\n•\\n \\nDetection Level: \\nUS: C; DRV: B\\n\\n•\\n \\nGCI Level:\\n 3\\n\\n•\\n \\nWeather:\\n Southwest Monsoon, Clear\\n\\n•\\n \\nOpen DRV Airfields:\\n  Phuc Yen, 1529 (MiG-17, MiG-21); \\n\\nKep, 1120 (MiG-21); Gia Lam, 2027 (MiG-17, MiG-21); \\n\\nHoa Lac, 2035 (MiG-17, MiG-21)\\n\\nUS Order of Battle\\n\\nUse Table A for an Air Force raid or Table B for a USN raid. \\n\\nCarrier ID: choose from either X—\\nOriskany\\n or Z—\\nCoral Sea.\\n\\nUS Pilot Quality\\n\\n   \\nUSAF: Iron Hand units—Veteran; other units—Trained\\n\\n   \\nUSN: F-8 units—Top Gun; other units—Regular\\n\\nDRV Order of Battle\\n\\nAir Units\\n\\n   \\nBasic MAPs: 13\\n\\n   \\nDummy flights: 3\\n\\n   \\nAvailable aircraft types: MiG-17F, MiG-21PF', '2\\n1\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\nReinforcements\\n\\n \\nVP\\n                 \\n1\\n              \\n2\\n              \\n3\\n              \\n5\\n              \\n8\\n\\n \\nMAPs\\n          \\n+7\\n           \\n+10\\n          \\n+13\\n          \\n+19\\n          \\n+26\\n\\nGround Units\\n\\n   \\nSAM Battalions: 25 (set up 8 located)\\n\\n   \\nDummy SAMs: 4\\n\\n   \\nDummy Radars: 1\\n\\n   \\nAAA Points: 8\\n\\n   \\nFire Can: 11\\n\\nDRV Pilot Quality\\n\\n   \\nMiG-17 units—Trained\\n\\n   \\nMiG-21 units—Veteran\\n\\nScenario Special Rules\\n\\n1.\\nSubtract an additional 1 modifier from MiG Panic rolls \\n\\n[13.12].\\n\\n2.\\nF-4Ds carry AIM-4D IRMs.\\n\\n3.\\nUSAF raids equip one F-105 flight in the Strike mission with \\n\\nAIM-9B.

Scenario by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nIn November 1967 the coming of the Northeast monsoon coated \\n\\nthe Red River delta with thick cloud. With visual bombing \\n\\npermitted on just a few days each month, the Air Force tried \\n\\nto sustain the attacks by using blind bombing techniques. A \\n\\nradio beacon—designated Site 85—had just opened in Laos, \\n\\npermitting use of the Combat Skyspot bombing system. F-105Fs \\n\\nfitted with the system began flying as pathfinders to formations \\n\\nof bombers.\\n\\nHowever, the attacks turned into tragedy. The USAF EC-121K \\n\\nʻRivet Topʼ aircraft, with their integrated signals intelligence and \\n\\nIFF interrogation capability, had to stand down for modifications, \\n\\nleaving only the unmodified ʻCollege Eyeʼ EC-121D radar planes \\n\\nto cover the DRVʼs airspace. This degraded the Air Forceʼs \\n\\nearly warning capability at a time when MiGs were acting \\n\\naggressively.\\n\\nSAM units changed their radar frequencies to partially negate \\n\\nthe American defensive jamming. The DRV also discovered that \\n\\nthe pathfinder-led bombers would ʻbunch upʼ for attacks, further \\n\\nreducing the effectiveness of their jamming.\\n\\nCasualties were high, to the extent that the Air Force had to stop \\n using large bombing formations for Commando Club raids—now \\n\\ndubbed ʻCommando Kazeʼ by the aircrews.\\n\\nTargets\\n\\nThe US player secretly rolls a die to determine their target.\\n\\n  \\nRoll\\n  \\nTarget\\n                                               \\nHex\\n     \\nProfile\\n    \\nOrganization\\n\\n \\n1-4\\n \\nPhuc Yen airfield runway\\n     \\n1529\\n     \\nB\\n      \\nUSAF\\n\\n \\n5-6\\n \\nThuy Phoung barge \\n            \\n1829\\n     \\nC\\n      \\nUSAF\\n\\n            \\nconstruction yard\\n\\n7-10\\nHoa Lac airfield runway\\n      \\n2035\\n     \\nB\\n      \\nUSAF\\n\\nScenario Conditions\\n\\n•\\n \\nDate:\\n November 1967\\n\\n•\\n \\nTime of Day:\\n Day, 10:30 hrs\\n\\n•\\n \\nDetection Level:\\n US: E; DRV: C\\n\\n•\\n \\nGCI Level:\\n 3\\n\\n•\\n \\nWeather:\\n Northeast Monsoon, Poor weather\\n\\n•\\n \\nOpen DRV Airfields:\\n  Phuc Yen, 1529 (MiG-17, MiG-21); \\n\\nKep, 1120 (MiG-21); Hoa Lac, 2035 (MiG-17, MiG-21); \\n\\nDong Suong, 2533 (MiG-17)\\n\\nUS Order of Battle\\n\\nOnly USAF raids are flown.

Scenario by Jean Foisy.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nOn 30 March 1972 the DRV launched its \\n Nguyen Hue\\n offensive \\n\\nagainst a South Vietnam weakened by the withdrawal of \\n\\nAmerican GIs. President Nixon demanded a strong response to \\n\\nthe invasion, ordering the massive application of US airpower. \\n\\nUSAF and USN aircraft struck targets south of the Demilitarized \\n\\nZone in support of forces engaged with the North Vietnamese \\n\\nArmy. They also launched raids north of the DMZ up to the \\n\\n20th Parallel.\\n\\nA coordinated series of strikes on the DRV supply system in the \\n\\nupper route packages was ordered for 16 April and was named \\n\\nFreedom Porch Bravo.\\n  These included the first B-52 raids close \\n\\nto population centers. For a Vietnamese public unused to heavy \\n\\nbombing, this caused consternation and panic. To calm fears, \\n\\nHanoi made a rash promise to shoot down one of the BUFFs, \\n\\nbut most ordinary Vietnamese remained skeptical about their \\n\\nability to do this.\\n\\nOn 9 May, the day before Operation Linebacker began, the \\n\\nUSN mined Haiphong harbor without loss. This mining effort, \\n\\ncombined with mines at other ports, halted all sea traffic into \\n\\nNorth Vietnam. From here to the end of the war, the DRVʼs only \\n\\nconnection to the wider world were the thin ribbons of railroads \\n\\nand highways running north into China.\\n\\n(Note: This scenario combines the events of \\nFreedom Porch \\n\\nBravo\\n with the Haiphong mining in a ʻmini-campaignʼ.)\\n\\nTargets\\n\\nThe following lists the US targets for the raid.\\n\\n    \\nTarget\\n                                                    \\nHex\\n     \\nProfile\\n   \\nOrganization\\n\\n   \\nNguyen Khe POL storage\\n        \\n1628\\n     \\nD\\n      \\nUSAF\\n\\n   \\nGia Thuong storage area\\n          \\n1928\\n     \\nC\\n\\n   \\nDuc Noi storage area\\n               \\n1728\\n     \\nC\\n   \\nKien An ammunition depot\\n     \\n2612\\n     \\nD\\n      \\nUSN\\n\\n   \\nKien An airfield runway\\n          \\n2612\\n     \\nB\\n\\n   \\nDo Son POL storage\\n                \\n2809\\n     \\nD\\n\\n   \\nKien An POL storage\\n              \\n2612\\n     \\nD\\n      \\nUSN (B-52)\\n\\n   \\nHaiphong POL storage\\n            \\n2411\\n     \\nD\\n      \\n\\n   \\nHaiphong harbor (minefields)\\n \\n2708\\n  \\nNone\\n   \\nUSN \\n\\n                                                     \\n2608\\n               \\n(mining)\\n\\n                                                     \\n2509\\n\\n   \\nBac Mai storage\\n                       \\n2129\\n     \\nC\\n      \\nUSN\\n\\n   \\nVan Dien vehicle storage\\n          \\n2327\\n     \\nC\\n\\n   \\nGia Lam POL storage\\n              \\n1928\\n     \\nD\\n      \\nUSAF, USN \\n\\n   \\nHanoi POL storage\\n                  \\n2129\\n     \\nD\\n      \\n(B-52)\\n\\n   \\nQuinh Loi SAM storage\\n          \\n2128\\n     \\nD\\n\\n   \\nHoa Lac airfield runway\\n          \\n2035\\n     \\nB\\n      \\nUSAF\\n\\n   \\nSon Tay barracks and depot\\n     \\n1735\\n     \\nD\\n\\n   \\nKep airfield runway\\n                 \\n1120\\n     \\nB\\n      \\nUSAF, USN\\n\\n   \\nBac Giang POL storage\\n           \\n1421\\n     \\nD\\n\\n   \\nPhuc Yen POL storage\\n              \\n1529\\n     \\nD\\n      \\nUSAF\\n\\n   \\nViet Tri POL storage\\n                 \\n1337\\n     \\nD\\n\\n   \\nSAM sites\\n                                   \\n?\\n         \\n?\\n      \\nUSAF, USN\\n\\n   \\nTrai Ca SAM storage facility\\n  \\n0626\\n     \\nD\\n      \\nUSAF (B-52)\\n\\n   \\nThai Nguyen supply depot\\n      \\n0728\\n     \\nD\\n\\n  \\n\\nScenario Conditions\\n\\n•\\n \\nDate:\\n 16 April and 9 May 1972\\n\\n•\\n \\nTime of Day\\n\\n   \\nNight Raid 1: Night, No Moon, 05:00 hrs\\n\\n   \\nMorning Raid: Day, 0700 hrs\\n\\n   \\nMidday Raid: Day, 12:00 hrs\\n\\n   \\nAfternoon Raid: Day, 16:00 hrs\\n\\n   \\nNight Raid 2: Night, No Moon, 22:00 hrs\\n\\n•\\n \\nDetection Level:\\n US: C; DRV: A\\n\\n•\\n \\nGCI Level: \\n4\\n\\n•\\n \\nWeather:\\n Northeast Monsoon, clear weather.

None of the campaign rules apply \\n\\nexcept for 28.43 (Persistence of Damage and destruction) and \\n\\n28.44 (SAM Ammo).\\n\\n2.\\n  \\nThe US player must perform four raids during the day: one \\n\\nof the two night raids and the morning, midday and afternoon \\n\\nraids. Choose whether the night raid is played first or last in \\n\\nthe sequence. The night raid must be a B-52 raid. One of the \\n\\nother raids must be a mining raid. The US player may not \\n\\nplay more than one B-52 or mining raid each. The remaining \\n\\nraids may be any mix of USAF or USN raids the US player \\n\\nchooses.\\n\\n3.\\n  \\nDRV MAPs are 0 for a night or morning raid and 26 for each \\n\\nother raid. Reinforcements can be purchased for all raids as \\n\\nusual, but the reinforcement VP for all four raids contributes \\n\\nto the victory conditions.\\n\\n4.\\n  \\nWhere two or more targets are listed together, a raid can attack \\n\\nall those targets.\\n 5.\\n  \\nThe mining raid must attack the three listed Haiphong \\n\\nharbor hexes. The bombing flights are carrying special mine \\n\\nordnance (treat as bombs except they may only be used for \\n\\nmining hexes). To mine a hex, complete a level bombing run \\n\\nat Deck altitude with the hex as a target. Each aircraft that \\n\\ncompletes the bomb run lays a point of mines in the hex. No \\n\\nattack die roll is necessary.\\n\\n6.\\n  \\nThree SAM site targets are designated by the US player after \\n\\nthe DRV has set up its defense on the map. Any three located \\n\\nsites may be treated as targets and score Victory Points for \\n\\ndamage or destruction, even if they are dummies.\\n\\n7.\\n  \\nUSAF strikes are Major Raids. (See order of battle \\n\\nvariants.)\\n\\n8.\\n  \\nAll F-4Ds tasked with CAP have IFF interrogators [11.54].\\n\\n9.\\n  \\nB-52 raids (only) may use Green entry arrows.\\n\\n10.\\nB-52 flights do not jettison ordnance as the result of air \\n\\ncombat, MiG panic or morale checks.\\n\\n11.\\nIn USN raids half of all flights tasked with bombing may use \\n\\nEOGB.\\n\\nVictory Conditions\\n\\nAssess victory conditions only after all four raids have been \\n\\ncompleted.\\n\\nStandard Victory conditions for raid scenarios apply [27.8]; \\n\\nhowever, ignore the standard Victory Point awards for target \\n\\ndamage. Instead, for each target in the target list, the US player \\n\\nscores 1 VP if it is heavily damaged (damaged for SAM sites) \\n\\nand 2 VP is it is totally destroyed. Score 1 VP for every three \\n\\nfull mine points successfully laid.\\n\\nEXAMPLE: The USAF raid attacking Nguyen Khe POL storage, \\n\\nGia Thuong storage area and Duc Noi storage area can score a \\n\\npotential maximum of 3 x 2 = 6VP if all are totally destroyed.\\n\\nThe Victory Level is calculated from the VP total as usual.\\n\\nD11: Superfly\\n\\nScenario D11. Scenario by Gordon Christie.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nAmerica responded to the DRVʼs 1972 spring offensive by \\n\\nrapidly reinforcing US air power in South East Asia, returning \\n\\nforces to Rolling Thunder levels. In an effort to halt the offensive \\n\\nwithout committing American ground troops an interdiction \\n\\ncampaign was launched. President Nixon lifted many of the \\n\\nrules of engagement that had restricted US air power during \\n\\nRolling Thunder. However, early attacks were frustrated by bad \\n\\nweather.\\n\\nBy early May the weather had begun to improve. The South \\n\\nVietnamese were under heavy pressure and US air power had not \\n\\nyet turned the tide. So Nixon launched Operation Linebacker, a \\n\\ncampaign against the Northʼs supply network.', '2\\n4\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\nBoth sides had used the years since Rolling Thunder to improve \\n\\ntheir forces. The DRV had many more MiGs available in addition \\n\\nto the formidable SAM and AAA defenses. The USAF had \\n\\nimproved equipment, formations and tactics, most significantly \\n\\nwith the introduction of the new precision-guided bombs, while \\n\\nthe US Navy had invested heavily in air combat training at their \\n\\nTop Gun school.\\n\\nOn 10 May 1972 the USAF and USN struck the Red River Delta \\n\\nin force.

Scenario by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe month of May 1972 couldnʼt be over fast enough for the \\n\\npilots of the Vietnamese Peopleʼs Air Force (VPAF). Dreadful \\n\\nlosses and a number of friendly fire accidents had forced the \\n\\nVPAF high command to call a crisis meeting of fighter regiment \\n\\ncommanders to examine deficiencies and make improvements. \\n\\nThe discussions were rigorous and effective. Over-aggressive \\n\\ncommanders and pilots were reined in. The policy of throwing \\n\\ndefeated pilots back into battle, without properly learning their \\n\\nlessons first, was quietly dropped.\\n\\nJune 1972 came bright and clear, bringing more of the hated \\n\\nYankee Air Pirates, and new attacks on the network of Russian-\\n\\nsupplied early warning radars. But the VPAF was better prepared \\n\\nthis time.

Scenario by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nHanoi. A freezing cold December night in 1972. At Air Defense \\n\\nCommand Headquarters reports were flooding in from outlying \\n\\nradar regiments, tracking the streams of B-52s flying in procession \\n\\ntoward the capital. The DRV commanders had feared this moment \\n\\nfor the past eight years.\\n\\nThe American chaff bombers arrived first, but a mistake in \\n\\nAmerican planning meant that chaff corridors intended to protect \\n\\nthe BUFFs had dispersed or blown off-course. They would play \\n\\nno part in the coming battle. Then the F-111s arrived, barreling \\n\\nin at low-level to pin night fighters in their bases. They were \\n\\nfollowed ten minutes later by a wave of forty-eight BUFFs, \\n\\ncreeping by the light of a full moon into airspace protected by \\n\\nthe 361st Air Defense Division and the 921st \\nSao Dao\\n Fighter \\n\\nRegiment at Noi Bai, where future cosmonaut Pham Tuan sat \\n\\nready on the runway in his MiG-21.\\n\\nThe targets for the first wave were the major airfields in the \\n\\nRed River valley, and storage and rail yards near Hanoi. Even \\n\\nthough they had no chaff protection the B-52s—in particular \\n\\nthe upgraded B-52Ds—were pumping out jamming that nearly \\n\\nblanked out the SAM battalionsʼ radar screens. However, the \\n\\nVietnamese missile operators were to discover chinks in the \\n\\nBUFFsʼ electronic armor and exploit it for deadly effect.\\n\\nTargets\\n\\nThe following lists the US targets for the raid.\\n\\n    \\nTarget\\n                                                \\nHex\\n      \\nProfile\\n     \\nOrganization\\n\\n   \\nKep airfield runway\\n              \\n1120\\n       \\nB\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n   \\nPhuc Yen airfield runway\\n      \\n1529\\n       \\nB\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n   \\nKinh No storage area 1\\n         \\n1628\\n       \\nC\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n   \\nKinh No storage area 2\\n                        \\nC\\n\\n   \\nKinh No storage area 3\\n                        \\nC\\n\\n   \\nYen Vien rail yard East\\n          \\n1826\\n       \\nC\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\n   \\nYen Vien rail yard West\\n                        \\nC\\n\\n   \\nHoa Lac airfield runway\\n       \\n2035\\n       \\nB\\n       \\nUSAF\\n\\nScenario Conditions\\n\\n•\\n \\nDate:\\n 18 December 1972\\n\\n•\\n \\nTime of Day: \\nNight, Full Moon, 18:40 hrs\\n\\n•\\n \\nDetection Level:\\n US: D; DRV: A\\n •\\n \\nGCI Level:\\n 4\\n\\n•\\n \\nWeather:\\n Do not roll for weather.

Scenario by Jean Foisy.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe DRV Air Defense Command was jubilant following the first \\n\\nthree nights of Linebacker II. They had kept their word to the \\n\\nVietnamese people that they could shoot down enemy B-52s. \\n\\nSAM defenses had inflicted horrific casualties on the BUFF \\n\\nforces. The Vietnamese believed they had pushed America \\n\\nclose to defeat in a battle they referred to as an “aerial Dien Bien \\n\\nPhu”.\\n\\nBut the nighttime battles were exhausting the SAM battalions. A \\n\\nbottleneck in the assembly of fresh SA-2 missiles had resulted in \\n\\ncritical shortages of the weapon. The SAMs had to stand down \\n\\nduring the daytime, conceding the skies to USAF tactical aircraft \\n\\nthat could roam at will. Meanwhile the Vietnamese airfields were \\n\\nin poor shape after the American bombing and those few MiGs \\n\\nthat hadnʼt been dispersed into the countryside were being kept \\n\\nat readiness for night fighting.\\n On 21 December the weather was bright and clear enough for the \\n\\nUSAF to launch strikes with precision bombs.

Scenario by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe botched American attacks of the first few days of Linebacker \\n\\nII had left the campaign balanced on a knife-edge. The Vietnamese \\n\\nbelieved they were on the verge of victory if they could just \\n\\nhold out a little longer. President Nixon knew that another day \\n\\nof serious casualties amongst Strategic Air Commandʼs B-52s \\n\\nwould tip the scales. Congress would convene, money for the war \\n\\nwould dry up, the American POWs in Hanoi would be abandoned. \\n\\nAll hinged on the outcome of 26 December.\\n\\nBrigadier Glenn R. Sullivan, commander of the B-52s at U-\\n\\nTapao in Thailand, pulled SACʼs fat out of the fire. Frustrated \\n\\nby poor tactics and micromanagement by SAC HQ in Nebraska \\n\\nhe galvanized SAC to hand over to the local command of the \\n\\n8th Air Force at Guam.

Scenario by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nRolling Thunder 55 marked a new escalation in Americaʼs war \\n\\nagainst North Vietnam. For the past two years the DRV MiG \\n\\nbases had been off-limits to attacks—safe sanctuaries for the \\n\\nMiGs to flee to. To the immense frustration of American pilots, \\n\\nrules of engagement prevented them from attacking MiGs until \\n\\nthey were in the air. Now the President had cleared them to go \\n\\nafter the MiGs on the ground. Major airfields such as Kep and \\n\\nHoa Lac were struck for the first time. Only the main base at \\n\\nPhuc Yen remained off-limits.', '3\\n1\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\nPower stations were another new target, with power plants hit \\n\\nacross the delta, reducing the capacity of the North Vietnamese \\n\\nelectricity grid and striking a blow against their industry. In \\n\\nresponse, the Vietnamese MiGs came up in numbers. They were \\n\\naggressive and more skilful than before, but the Vietnamese were \\n\\nto learn yet again that they could not win a stand-up fight against \\n\\nthe superior numbers of Americans. They were better suited to \\n\\nharry and hound the Yankee Air Pirates rather than battle toe-to \\n\\ntoe. Casualties amongst the MiG pilots mounted.\\n\\nTargets\\n\\nThe following lists the US targets for the campaign.\\n\\n                                                               \\n                      \\nOrgani-\\n     \\nCampaign\\n\\n   \\nTarget\\n                                     \\nHex\\n      \\nProfile\\n         \\nzation\\n             \\n VP\\n\\n  \\nKep airfield runway\\n      \\n1120\\n       \\nB\\n    \\nUSAF, USN\\n   \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nKep control tower\\n                        \\nC\\n                            \\n1/4/6\\n\\n  \\nKep aircraft revetments\\n               \\nB\\n                            \\n1/4/6\\n\\n  \\nXuan Mai insurgency\\n   \\n2334\\n       \\nC\\n         \\nUSAF\\n       \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\nschool\\n\\n  \\nThai Nguyen iron \\n        \\n0628\\n       \\nB\\n         \\nUSAF\\n       \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\nand steel complex\\n\\n  \\nHoa Lac airfield\\n            \\n2035\\n       \\nB\\n         \\nUSAF\\n        \\n1/4/7\\n\\n     \\nrunway\\n\\n  \\nHoa Lac control tower\\n                 \\nC\\n                            \\n1/3/4\\n\\n  \\nHoa Lac aircraft \\n                          \\nB\\n                            \\n1/3/4\\n\\n     \\nrevetments\\n\\n  \\nCanal des Rapides\\n        \\n1927\\n       \\nA\\n         \\nUSAF\\n       \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\nBridge (2 spans)\\n\\n  \\nHanoi railroad repair\\n    \\n2028\\n       \\nC\\n         \\nUSAF\\n        \\n2/6/9\\n\\n     \\nshops\\n\\n  \\nYen Vien Railyard\\n         \\n1826\\n       \\nC\\n         \\nUSAF\\n        \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nNguyen Khe\\n                 \\n1628\\n       \\nD\\n        \\nUSAF\\n       \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\nPOL storage\\n\\n  \\nHa Dong Army\\n             \\n2130\\n       \\nC\\n         \\nUSAF\\n       \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\nbarracks\\n\\n  \\nHanoi railyard\\n               \\n2028\\n       \\nC\\n         \\nUSAF\\n        \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nHanoi thermal\\n               \\n1929\\n       \\nB\\n         \\nUSAF\\n       \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\npower plant\\n\\n  \\nHanoi Le Pap\\n                \\n1929\\n       \\nB\\n         \\nUSAF\\n       \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\ntransformer\\n\\n  \\nDuong Nham POL\\n        \\n2013\\n       \\nD\\n         \\nUSN\\n        \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\nstorage\\n\\n  \\nHaiphong POL storage\\n \\n2411\\n       \\nD\\n         \\nUSN\\n        \\n3/7/11\\n\\n  \\nHaiphong cement plant\\n2411\\n       \\nB\\n          \\nUSN\\n        \\n3/7/11\\n\\n  \\nHaiphong East \\n             \\n2410\\n       \\nB\\n          \\nUSN\\n        \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\nthermal power plant\\n\\n  \\nHaiphong West \\n            \\n2411\\n       \\nB\\n          \\nUSN\\n        \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\nthermal power plant\\n\\n  \\nUong Bi power station\\n \\n1909\\n       \\nB\\n          \\nUSN\\n        \\n3/7/11\\n  \\nBac Giang \\n                    \\n1421\\n       \\nB\\n    \\nUSAF, USN\\n  \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\npower station\\n\\n  \\nHon Gai railyard\\n           \\n2202\\n       \\nC\\n          \\nUSN\\n         \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nKien An airfield \\n           \\n2612\\n       \\nB\\n          \\nUSN\\n         \\n1/4/7\\n\\n     \\nrunway\\n\\n  \\nKien An control tower\\n                 \\nC\\n                            \\n1/3/4\\n\\n  \\nKien An aircraft revetments\\n        \\nB\\n                            \\n1/3/4\\n\\nScenario Conditions\\n\\n•\\n \\nDate:\\n April 1967\\n\\n•\\n \\nCampaign Length:\\n 5 days\\n\\n•\\n \\nDetection Level:\\n US: E; DRV: B\\n\\n•\\n \\nGCI Level:\\n 3\\n\\n•\\n \\nWeather:\\n Northeast Monsoon, clear\\n\\n•\\n \\nOpen DRV Airfields:\\n Phuc Yen, 1529 (MiG-17, MiG-21); \\n\\nGia Lam, 2027 (MiG-17, MiG-21); Kep, 1120 (MiG-17, \\n\\nMiG-21); Hoa Lac, 2035 (MiG-17, MiG-21); Kien An, 2612 \\n\\n(MiG-17)\\n\\n•\\n \\nCampaign Type:\\n Joint\\n\\nUS Order of Battle\\n\\nUse table A for USAF raids.

(They \\n\\nabandon the airfield and send aircraft into dispersal.) They \\n\\ncan do this prior to the start of the campaign or in any DRV \\n\\nRefit and Redeployment Phase.

Scenario by Lee Brimmicombe-Wood.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nMay 1972. Linebacker saw US airpower return to the Red River \\n\\ndelta in force. Navy airplanes from Task Force 77 pounded the \\n\\ncountryside from the coastline up to the northeast rail line while \\n\\nGeneral Vogtʼs 7th Air Force employed massive strike formations \\n\\nagainst the DRV air defenses. New tactics, such as chaff corridors, \\n\\nallowed American aircraft to penetrate unharmed to the very \\n\\nheart of Downtown Hanoi.\\n\\nThe primary targets of Linebacker were the supply arteries \\n\\nrunning into and out of Hanoi. Attempts were made to cut \\n\\nhighways and railroads, and isolate Hanoi from Haiphong and \\n\\nChina. Attention was also paid to the air defense system, hitting \\n\\nthe airfields and encouraging the enemy to disperse their MiG \\n\\nforce into the countryside.\\n\\nPrecision munitions were a Godsend to the Americans. Gone \\n\\nwere the days when vital bridges had to be struck and struck \\n\\nagain to take them down. With the new bombs one attack \\n\\ncould do the job. The only North Vietnamese countermeasure \\n\\nwas to rebuild the bridges and roads as fast as they could be \\n\\nbombed—to create bypass bridges or underwater causeways that \\n\\nwere invisible from the air. Ingenuity underlay the Vietnamese \\n\\nreaction to American technological superiority and they were to \\n\\nbuild a myth of defiance around it.\\n\\nTargets\\n\\nThe following lists the US targets for the campaign.\\n\\n  \\n\\n                                                               \\n                        \\nOrgani-\\n   \\nCampaign\\n\\n   \\nTarget\\n                                            \\nHex\\n  \\nProfile\\n       \\nzation\\n           \\n VP\\n\\n  \\nPhuc Yen airfield runway\\n   \\n1529\\n   \\nB\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nPhuc Yen control tower\\n                  \\nC\\n                         \\n1/4/6\\n\\n  \\nPhuc Yen aircraft revetments\\n          \\nB\\n                         \\n1/4/6\\n\\n  \\nKep airfield runway\\n           \\n1120\\n   \\nB\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nKep control tower\\n                          \\nC\\n                         \\n1/4/6\\n\\n  \\nKep aircraft revetments\\n                 \\nB\\n                         \\n1/4/6\\n\\n  \\nHoa Lac airfield runway\\n    \\n2035\\n   \\nB\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n1/4/7\\n\\n  \\nHoa Lac control tower\\n                   \\nC\\n                         \\n1/3/4\\n\\n  \\nHoa Lac aircraft revetments\\n          \\nB\\n                         \\n1/3/4\\n\\n  \\nBac Mai air defense center\\n  \\n2129\\n   \\nA\\n        \\nUSAF\\n     \\n3/7/11\\n\\n  \\nPaul Doumer Bridge\\n          \\n1928\\n   \\nA\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n     \\n(6 spans)\\n\\n  \\nCanal des Rapides Bridge\\n \\n1927\\n   \\nA\\n        \\nUSAF\\n     \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\n(2 spans)\\n\\n  \\nBac Giang bridge\\n               \\n1421\\n   \\nA\\n   \\nUSAF, USN\\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\n (1 span)\\n\\n  \\nBac Giang railyard\\n            \\n1421\\n   \\nC\\n   \\nUSAF, USN\\n \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nBac Giang POL storage\\n     \\n1421\\n   \\nD\\n   \\nUSAF, USN\\n \\n2/6/9', '3\\n4\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\n                                                               \\n                        \\nOrgani-\\n   \\nCampaign\\n\\n   \\nTarget\\n                                            \\nHex\\n  \\nProfile\\n       \\nzation\\n           \\n VP\\n\\n  \\nGia Lam railroad\\n               \\n1928\\n   \\nC\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n     \\nrepair shops\\n\\n  \\nHanoi railyard\\n                    \\n2028\\n   \\nC\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nKep railyard\\n                       \\n1019\\n   \\nC\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nNguyen Khe POL storage\\n  \\n1628\\n   \\nC\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nPhuc Yen POL storage\\n        \\n1529\\n   \\nC\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nYen Vien Railyard\\n              \\n1826\\n   \\nC\\n        \\nUSAF\\n      \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nKien An airfield runway\\n    \\n2612\\n   \\nB\\n         \\nUSN\\n       \\n1/4/7\\n\\n  \\nKien An control tower\\n                   \\nC\\n                         \\n1/3/4\\n\\n  \\nKien An aircraft revetments\\n          \\nB\\n                         \\n1/3/4\\n\\n  \\nHaiphong POL storage\\n      \\n2411\\n   \\nD\\n         \\nUSN\\n      \\n3/7/11\\n\\n  \\nHaiphong rail yard\\n             \\n2410\\n   \\nC\\n         \\nUSN\\n       \\n2/6/9\\n\\n  \\nHaiphong rail bridge\\n         \\n2411\\n   \\nA\\n         \\nUSN\\n      \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\n(1 span)\\n\\n  \\nNam Dinh supply depot\\n    \\n3521\\n   \\nC\\n         \\nUSN\\n       \\n1/4/7\\n\\n  \\nPhu Ly railroad bridge\\n       \\n3326\\n   \\nB\\n         \\nUSN\\n      \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\n(1 span)\\n\\n  \\nPhu Ly highway bridge\\n     \\n3326\\n   \\nB\\n         \\nUSN\\n      \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\n(1 span)\\n\\n  \\nHai Duong bridge\\n              \\n2217\\n   \\nA\\n         \\nUSN\\n      \\n3/7/11\\n\\n     \\n(1 span)\\n\\n  \\nMe Xa bridge (1 span)\\n       \\n2117\\n   \\nA\\n         \\nUSN\\n      \\n3/7/11\\n\\n  \\nHon Gai port\\n                      \\n2202\\n   \\nC\\n         \\nUSN\\n       \\n2/6/9\\n\\n \\n\\nScenario Conditions\\n\\n•\\n \\nDate:\\n May 1972\\n\\n•\\n \\nCampaign Length:\\n 5 days\\n\\n•\\n \\nDetection Level:\\n US: C; DRV: A\\n\\n•\\n \\nGCI Level:\\n 4\\n\\n•\\n \\nWeather:\\n Southwest Monsoon, clear\\n\\n•\\n \\nOpen DRV Airfields:\\n Phuc Yen, 1529 (MiG-17, MiG-19, \\n\\nMiG-21); Gia Lam, 2027 (MiG-17, MiG-19, MiG-21); Kep, \\n\\n1120 (MiG-17, MiG-19, MiG-21); Yen Bai, 0248 (MiG-17, \\n\\nMiG-19, MiG-21); Hoa Lac, 2035 (MiG-17); Kien An, 2612 \\n\\n(MiG-17)\\n\\n•\\n \\nCampaign Type:\\n Joint\\n\\nUS Order of Battle\\n\\nUse table D for USAF raids.

Here, radar and visual plots would be filtered and \\n\\ncollated to build an air picture. The HQ staff could then assign \\n\\ntargets to the rocket forces (SAM units) and direct MiGs to their \\n\\ntargets.\\n\\n  \\n\\n   \\nDate\\n                  \\nDetection Level\\n\\n   \\n1965\\n                             \\nC\\n\\n   \\n1966-1969\\n                    \\nB\\n\\n   \\n1970-1972\\n                    \\nA\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe Detection Level is reduced by one for bad-weather raids. \\n\\nThis reflects the contribution of the ground observers. \\n\\nUS Detection Levels\\n\\nThe US was highly reliant on electronic detection. \\n\\nThe USAF employed ground radars on the Thailand/Laos \\n\\nborder, but these could not pick up targets at low altitude over \\n\\nthe Red River. From 1965 EC-121D ʻCollege Eyeʼ radar aircraft, \\n\\noperating under the callsign ʻDiscoʼ, would fly tracks over the \\n\\nGulf of Tonkin or Laos to provide additional warning and direct \\n\\nfighters against MiGs. Low-level coverage was better than the \\n\\nground stations, but still MiGs would get lost in the ʻground \\n\\nclutterʼ on the Air Forceʼs radar scopes.\\n From July 1966 USN radar ships in the Gulf of Tonkin, \\n\\ncodenamed ʻRed Crownʼ, could cover much of the Red River \\n\\nValley and supply warnings to aircraft. However, the further \\n\\naway MiGs flew from the sea, the more Red Crownʼs low-level \\n\\ncoverage degraded.\\n\\nThe USAFʼs EC-121 fleet was continuously improved during \\n\\nthe war. IFF interrogation devices were added to track the MiG \\n\\nidentification transponders. Initially this information had to be \\n\\nused sparingly to prevent the system being compromised, but \\n\\nlater, use of IFF became more ʻactiveʼ. The arrival of the EC-\\n\\n121K ʻRivet Topʼ added a vital signals intelligence (SIGINT) \\n\\ncapability, and in the summer of 1972 ʻTeaballʼ, a highly \\n\\nclassified SIGINT source monitoring the DRVʼs MiG radio \\n\\nfrequencies, was introduced.\\n\\n  \\n\\n                                      \\nDetection \\n\\n   \\nDate\\n                              \\nLevel\\n       \\nNotes\\n\\n   \\nApr 1965-Jun 1966\\n          \\nF\\n           \\nDisco introduced\\n\\n   \\nJul-1966-Apr 1967\\n          \\nE\\n          \\nRed Crown introduced\\n\\n   \\nMay 1967-Sep 1967\\n        \\nD\\n          \\nIFF tracking introduced. \\n \\n\\n                                                           \\nRivet Top debuts.\\n\\n   \\nOct 1967-Jul 1972\\n           \\nC\\n          \\nActive IFF tracking\\n\\n   \\nAug 1972\\n                         \\nB\\n          \\nTeaball introduced\\n\\n  \\n\\nIn Nov 1967 Rivet Top aircraft were stood down for modifications. \\n\\n(Drop detection to E for the month.)\\n\\nFrom Sep 1972 onwards the DRV began to realize the US was \\n\\ntracking their IFF and took countermeasures.

The \\n\\nUS player rolls the Hai Duong bridge as the target for a US \\n\\nNavy strike. Referring to the order of battle tables, the US player \\n\\nlaunches a Navy Alpha strike from the \\n USS Coral Sea.\\n\\nFor this Navy raid two flights of two F-4B aircraft provide \\n\\nMiGCAP (Callsign Showtime, using generic flight counter #100 \\n\\nand Old Nick, using flight counter #101; in this account we will \\n\\nreference flights by the formula ʻcallsign/counterʼ).\\n\\nTwo further two-ship flights of F-4B (Tempest/102 and Killer/\\n\\n103) fly Armed Escort equipped with CBU to suppress SAMs and \\n\\nAAA threatening the strike force. Two flights of A-4E equipped \\n\\nwith Shrike ARMs (Silverfox/104 and Clansman/105) are \\n\\ndetailed to arrive one game turn behind the lead CAP. These ʻIron \\n\\nHandʼ forces will deal with SAM threats. The main strike force \\n\\nconsists of 4 flights each of four A-4Es (Bulldog/108, equipped \\n\\nwith CBU to suppress the flak over the target, Diamond/109, \\n\\nDogear/200 and Redcock/201, hauling regular bombs), which \\n\\nare covered by two further pairs of F-4Bs (Switchbox/106 and \\n\\nTaproom/107) flying CAP escort. The main strike is plotted to \\n\\nenter one game turn after the Iron Hand to exploit the narrow \\n\\nwindow of opportunity provided by the defence suppression \\n\\nforce.\\n The US plans a straight ingress to the target with a tightly \\n\\ncompressed strike package to minimize the DRVʼs chances to \\n\\nget their MiG force into position before the strikers enter the \\n\\nSAM zone.\\n\\nThe Early Warning Phase results in a Minimal warning for the \\n\\nDRV. No MiGs start airborne, though two flights are on alert at \\n\\nKep and Hoa Lac. This is a difficult result for the DRV. They must \\n\\nnow scramble their MiGs into position against the Navy.\\n\\nGame Turn 1 sees the MiGs take off from Kep and Hoa Lac \\n\\ntogether with a dummy flight from Phuc Yen. The lead USN \\n\\nMiGCAP and Armed Escort flights enter at medium altitude, \\n\\nundetected by the DRV due to the Minimal early warning. Just \\n\\nshort of the coast the CAP climbs to high altitude.\\n\\nThe lead Phantoms go ʻfeet dryʼ on Game Turn 2 as the Iron \\n\\nHand force enters the map. MiG counters C, U and J accelerate \\n\\nto combat speed and head for the action on the deck, trying \\n\\nto keep below the US radar cover. Despite this, the US gets \\n\\nlucky, detecting MiG C, which has just launched from Kep, and \\n\\nrevealing it as a real MiG, not a dummy.\\n\\nOn Game Turn 3 the US moves Showtime/100 flight to cover \\n\\nthe MiGs at Kep. The DRV responds by climbing MiG C to \\n\\nmedium altitude. SAMs start to light up, though SAM Y (hex \\n\\nThis shows the situation around the Hanoi defenses at the end of \\n\\nGame Turn 3. Three MiG counters (only two of which represent \\n\\naircraft) are setting course to take on the vanguard of the Navy \\n\\nCAP.\\nThis is the US raid at the end of game turn 2. The dashed line \\n\\nrepresents the plotted flightpath (which is unknown to the DRV \\n\\nplayer). The broad shape of the incoming USN raid is becoming \\n\\nclear to the DRV, though the target (the bridge at Hai Duong) \\n\\nremains uncertain.', '3\\n8\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\n2918) fails to acquire the undetected Killer/103 flight. SAM P in \\n\\n2514 does better and gets a partial acquisition on Old Nick/101 \\n\\nwhile a new SAM, X, in 2810 comes online to get an acquisition \\n\\non Old Nick. Finally, the hidden medium-density AAA in 2017 \\n\\nbecomes active.\\n\\nGame Turn 4\\n\\nRandom Events Phase. \\nRoll 10: AAA Ambush on the deck. \\n\\nThereʼs no effect as there are no US flights on the deck.\\n\\nJamming Phase. \\nThe standoff jamming markers (both EA-1F \\n\\nʻElectric Spadsʼ) do not move.\\n\\nDetection Phase.\\n All of the US undetected flights are at medium \\n\\nand high altitude. The DRVʼs detection level is B. With no \\n\\nmodifiers the DRV must roll 10 or greater to detect a Navy flight. \\n\\nSilverfox/104, the A-4E Iron Hand flight, is detected.\\n\\nThe two undetected DRV flights on the deck both have –5 \\n\\nmodifiers (for deck altitude flight) in their favor. The US detection \\n\\nlevel is D, which means a roll of 18 or more is needed. With \\n\\nthese slim odds itʼs no surprise the US player fails to pick the \\n\\nflights up.\\n\\nTactics Note: The DRV is wise to keep their flights low, in the \\n\\nground clutter where they are unlikely to be detected.\\n\\nMovement Phase. \\n The DRV decides to move first. However, they \\n\\ndraw an initiative chit with a value of 0 for their first segment. \\n\\nPlay passes to the US player.\\n\\nThe US initiative chit is 2. They must move two flights. Armed \\n\\nescort flight Killer/103 moves to hex 3016, positioning itself \\n\\nfor a bombing run on the located SAM site in 2918 next turn. \\n\\nFlight Showtime/100 moves to hex 2913/NW at high altitude. \\n\\nThe CAP bides its time, waiting to see what the DRV does. Play \\n\\npasses back to the DRV.\\n\\nDRV initiative is 1. MiG C (from Kep) climbs to 1617/S at high \\n\\naltitude. Itʼs coming up for a fight! Play passes to the US.\\n\\nUS initiative is 3. The Navy strike mission enters the map. They \\n\\nare undetected at medium altitude, and flying in trail, ending their \\n\\nmoves at: 3710/NW (Bulldog/108), 3809/NW (Diamond-109), \\n\\n3909/NW (Dogear/200). The remainder of the strike mission \\n\\nremains off-map. Play passes to the DRV.\\n\\nDRV initiative is 2. MiG counter U in 2424 moves to hexside \\n\\n2522/2622 facing ESE. It remains undetected. On the deck, \\n\\nMiG J climbs to low on hexside 2333/2433 facing ESE. As the \\n\\nMiGs have all finished movement, all the US flights can finish \\n\\ntheir moves.\\n\\nFlight Taproom/107 stays at medium altitude and moves to \\n\\nhex 3414. Armed escort flight Tempest/102 moves to hexside \\n\\n3110/3111 facing N.\\n\\nCAP flight Old Nick/101 moves to 2517/N at high altitude, eight \\n\\nhexes away from MiG C. SAM battalions engage the CAP en \\n\\nroute. SAM X in 2810 fires at 5 hexes range as Old Nick passes \\n\\nthrough hex 2815. The attack roll has a –1 modifier for partial \\n\\nacquisition and rolls an 11 for no effect. The defending F-4s \\n\\nhave deception jammers and some offboard standoff jamming \\nby EA-1F jammers worth a +1 modifier. The defense roll results \\n\\nin no effect. SAM P in 2514 also takes a shot as the flight passes \\n\\nthrough 2616. The shot is again resolved with a partial acquisition \\n\\nmodifier and the aid of +1 standoff jamming. Both attack and \\n\\ndefense rolls result in a miss.\\n\\nThe final US moves of Game Turn 4 see the Iron Hand attack \\n\\nthe SAM sites which have just engaged.\\n\\nA-4 SEAD flight Silverfox/104 at medium altitude moves to \\n\\n3312, turns 30 degrees right (to N), moves to hexside 3211/3212 \\n\\nand lofts a Shrike ARM at SAM X in 2810. Since Silverfox is \\n\\ndetected, the SAM has a chance it might shut down its radar \\n\\nbefore the missile hits. A morale roll of 7 scuppers that idea and \\n\\nthe Shrike attacks. On the PGM column of the Air-to-Ground \\n\\nAttack Table the US player rolls 19 (!). The modifiers are –4 \\n\\nfor a lofted launch and –2 for an unlocated SAM, resulting in a \\n\\nmodified 13 for a success value of 2. A roll of 16 on the Damage \\n\\nTable damages the SAM. A lucky hit! Silverfox/104 completes \\n\\nits move to hexside 3011/3012 facing N.\\n\\nThe second SEAD flight, Clansman/105 moves to 3114, turns \\n\\n30 degrees right to N and lofts a Shrike at SAM B in 2514 from \\n\\nhexside 3013/3014. The SAM also fails to shut down. The US \\n\\nplayer rolls 15 with a –6 total modifier (lofted/unlocated) for a \\n\\n2 attack success but then has a miserable roll of 6 resulting in \\n\\nno effect against the SAM.\\n\\nFinally, CAP flight Switchbox/106 enters undetected at medium \\n\\naltitude and moves to 3612/NW.\\n\\nFuel Phase. \\nNo flights used dash movement, so there is no fuel \\n\\nreserve use.\\n\\nSAM Location Phase.\\n  SEAD flight Clansman/105 tries to locate \\n\\nSAM P in 2514. As the radar is still on Clansman can claim \\n\\nmodifiers of +1 for their Radar Warning Receiver and +5 for \\n\\nthe SAM launch counter on the SAM site. A roll of 6, modified \\n\\nto 12, locates the site.\\n\\nTrack Phase. \\nThe US player rolls 5 at detection level D, losing \\n\\ntrack of all DRV diamond flights. The track on MiG C lost and \\n\\nit becomes undetected again.\\n\\nThe DRV player rolls 16 at detection level B, losing track of all \\n\\nspade flights. Both Old Nick/101, Silverfox/104 and Taproom/\\n\\n107 become undetected.\\n\\nSAM Acquisition Phase.\\n SAM P in 2514 stays on and tries \\n\\nto retain partial acquisition on Old Nick/101. Modifiers are –3 \\n\\ndefensive jamming and –1 standoff jamming. A roll of 7 on \\n\\nthe Target Acquired column of the SAM Acquisition Table is \\n\\nmodified to \\n3\\n. The SAM barely retains partial acquisition.\\n\\nA new unlocated SAM, T, comes on in 3122. SAM T attempts a \\n\\nquick acquisition on Killer/103. With modifiers of –3 defensive \\n\\njamming; –1 standoff jamming and –3 quick acquisition on the \\n\\nTarget Detected column of the SAM Acquisition Table, a roll of \\n\\n9 fails to acquire the target. \\n\\nAdministration Phase.\\n  The only major event in this Phase is that \\n\\nthe SAM in 2918 shuts down. A new game turn starts.', '3\\n9\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\n\\n\\nThe situation at the end of Game Turn 4. The main strike has \\n\\nentered in the southeast corner. The Armed Escort and SEAD \\n\\nhave fanned out to engage the SAMs, only two of which remain \\n\\nlit up. Due to a fortunate Shrike ARM shot, the SAM battalion \\n\\njust to the west of Do Son has been damaged and is now out of \\n\\nthe action. The undetected MiG flight from Kep is approaching \\n\\nPha Lai and is going head-to-head with a Phantom CAP flight \\n\\nnear Hai Duong at high altitude.\\n\\nA detail of the developing situation. SAM X is damaged. SAM P \\n\\nis vulnerable to a second Shrike shot from Clansman/105. CAP \\n\\nflights Old Nick/101 and Showtime/100 are at high altitude, \\n\\nready to dash and engage MiG C. Killer/103 is gearing up for \\n\\nan attack on the located-but-shut-down SAM in 2918. Or is it a \\n\\ndummy radar?\\n Game Turn 5\\n\\nRandom Events Phase.\\n  The random events roll results in a AAA \\n\\nAmbush on the deck. As there are still no US flights on the deck \\n\\nthereʼs no effect.\\n\\nJamming Phase.\\n The standoff jamming markers do not move.\\n\\nDetection Phase.\\n The DRV rolls to try and detect Old Nick/101, \\n\\nSilverfox/104 and Taproom/107 they lost track of the previous \\n\\nTrack Phase. A 10 or greater is required on two dice. Rolls of 8, \\n\\n14 and 3 mean only Silverfox is detected. The DRV also fails \\n\\nto pick up the other CAP flight, Showtime/100, but does detect \\n\\nKiller/103, Switchbox/106, and the main strike comprising \\n\\nBulldog/108, Diamond/109 and Dogear/200.\\n\\nThe US player rolls for detection on the three MiG counters. \\n\\nFlight U on the deck gets –5 deck modifiers for a roll of 18 or \\n\\ngreater to detect. Flight J at low altitude gets a –3, needing a roll \\n\\nof 16 or better. The US fails to pick either up. MiG C at high \\n\\naltitude requires a 13 or better roll, but the US fails to roll this \\n\\ntoo. However, MiG C is in radar search parameters from Old \\n\\nNick/101. The base roll is 12 or greater and thereʼs a –2 modifier \\n\\nfor being 9 hexes away. A roll of 14 just manages to detect the \\n\\nMiG flight.\\n\\nMovement Phase.\\n The DRV elects to move first. They pull a \\n\\n2 initiative chit and must move 2 flights. A new MiG flight, B, \\n\\ntakes off from Gia Lam airport. MiG C moves to 1919, facing \\n\\nS. Play passes to the US.\\n\\nThe US initiative chit is 3. The SAM in 2918 is sitting close to \\n\\nthe egress route and needs to be taken out if possible. Armed \\n\\nEscort flight Killer/103 braves the SAMʼs organic flak in a dive-\\n\\nbombing run from an initial point on the hexside 2917/3017. \\n\\nThe US player sweats a bit when the flak rolls 16 and scores \\n\\na hit as the flight reaches low altitude. The flak damage roll \\n\\non the barrage column just misses with a roll of 11 (modifiers \\n\\nwere +1 for being on a bombing run). Because the flight was \\n\\nattacked by flak barrage, it is visually identified and its generic \\n\\ncounter (counter 103) is removed and replaced with the Killer \\n\\nflight counter.\\n\\nKiller then attacks the SAM site with cluster bombs. The F-4Bs \\n\\nhave a bomb strength of 1, doubled by the effect of CBUs versus \\n\\nSAMs to 2. This is multiplied by the number of undamaged \\n\\naircraft (2) to get a total attack value of 4. The modifiers are –1 \\n\\nattack modifier for the flak interference and –1 for bombing from \\n\\nLow altitude. Thereʼs a +1 modifier for attacking an unrevetted \\n\\nSAM site for a total of –1 modifiers. Rolling on the 4 column \\n\\nof the Air-to-Ground Attack Table an unimpressive roll of 8 \\n\\n(modified to 7) gets a 2 attack success. An 11 is rolled on the \\n\\nDamage Table, obtaining a Slight damage result which is enough \\n\\nto put the SAM and its radar (assuming itʼs not a camouflaged \\n\\ndummy SAM site) out of action. Killerʼs Phantoms climb out \\n\\nto medium altitude and finish movement on the 2818/2919 \\n\\nhexside.\\n\\nThe US player still has two flights to move on this initiative \\n\\nchit. Iron Hand flight Clansman/105 now moves to 2914 next \\n\\nand lofts a Shrike at SAM battalion B in hex 2514 which has a \\n\\npartial acquisition on flight Old Nick/101. The SAM rolls low on ', '4\\n0\\nDOWNTOWN Scenario Booklet\\n\\n© 2004 GMT Games, LLC\\n\\n\\nits morale roll and shuts down its radar, removing the acquisition \\n\\nmarker from Old Nick. Clansman/105 ends its turn in 2714/N. \\n\\nThe remaining SEAD flight, Silverfox/104 moves to hex 2915/W \\n\\nto deal with SAMs to the west in the area of Nam Dinh. Play \\n\\npasses to the DRV.\\n\\nDRV initiative chit is 1. MiG J moves to 2431/2532 hexside \\n\\nfacing ESE and climbs to medium altitude, setting itself up for \\n\\na dash at the strike. The MiGs are clearly feeling aggressive \\n\\ntoday!\\n\\nThe US initiative is 4. The strike mission continues moving \\n\\nnorthwest to 3312, 3411 and 3511. At last Old Nick-101 makes \\n\\nits run. The flight pushes up its afterburners to dash speed and \\n\\nhomes in on MiG C. It travels through hexes 2016, hexside 1917/\\n\\n2017 and 1918, which are all in the barrage zone of the Medium \\n\\nAAA in 2017. The DRV has to roll 17 of better to get a hit, and \\n\\nthree rolls of 4, 7 and 15 donʼt cut it. Old Nick attacks the MiG \\n\\nfrom 1918, facing WNW at high altitude.\\n\\nThe situation at the time the air combat starts. Old Nick has \\n\\njust engaged the MiG. Both flights are now visually identified. \\n\\nNote that because the Phantom flight is undetected, it stays on \\n\\nits undetected side.\\n\\nMiG C is detected but the F-4Bs of Old Nick flight are not. The \\n\\nPhantoms engage with a dice roll of 15, needing a 9 or better and \\n\\npossessing a +1 modifier for their aggression value. The MiGs \\n\\nfail their engagement roll. They roll 11 but need 15 against the \\n\\nundetected Phantoms, while their aggression value gives them a \\n\\n+0 modifier. The net result of the rolls (attacker engages, defender \\n\\ndoes not) is surprise against the MiGs, which are revealed as a \\n\\nsingle MiG-21.\\n\\nAir-to-air combat is now resolved. The Phantoms roll for shots \\n\\non the 2 column of the Maneuver Table. The modifiers are: +1 \\n\\nfor geometry, +3 for surprise, +1 for aggression differential, \\n –1\\n \\n\\nfor maneuver differential. A roll of \\n 12\\n (modified to 16) gives two \\n\\nshots. The MiG rolls on the 1 column of the Maneuver Table. The \\n\\nMiGʼs modifiers are: –1 for geometry, –1 for disadvantage, –1 for \\n\\nthe aggression differential and \\n +1\\n for the maneuver differential. \\n\\nA roll of \\n8\\n modified by \\n–2\\n pretty much means no shots for the \\n\\nVietnamese player.\\n\\nThe F-4 shots are now resolved. The Phantoms declare they \\n\\nare using AIM-9D infrared missiles as this is their best weapon \\n\\n(their AIM-7E Sparrows have a lower combat value). The first \\n\\nshot damages the MiG (dice roll 10, modified by +3 for AIM-9D \\n weapon, +1 for additional undepleted weapons = 14 or a damage \\n\\nresult). the second shot kills it (dice roll 13, modified to 17, kills \\n\\non a 16-19). The MiG flight is removed from the board.\\n\\nThe Phantoms roll for ammo depletion and run out of AIM-9Ds \\n\\non a die roll of 2. Now they roll a morale check with modifiers \\n\\nof +1 (aggression value) and a +1 (surprise). A poor roll of 8 \\n\\nis modified to a 10, resulting in disorder on the flight. Their \\n\\naggression rating is modified by –1 down to +0. After the battle \\n\\nthey scatter to hex 1818/NW at medium altitude and have a \\n\\nManeuver marker placed on them. With 4 US flights moved, \\n\\nplay now passes back to the DRV.\\n\\nThe DRV initiative is 1. MiG flight U moves to hexside 2619/\\n\\n2720, facing ESE on the deck. Play passes to the US player.\\n\\nThe US initiative is 2. With the threat from MiG C removed, \\n\\nthe US repositions the CAP to cover the MiGs coming from the \\n\\nHanoi area. Showtime/100 moves to 2716/W at high altitude and \\n\\nTaproom/107 moves to 3317/W, also at high altitude.\\n\\nThe DRV initiative is 2, but they have only 1 flight left to move. \\n\\nMiG flight J moves to hexside 2628/2729, facing ESE at low. \\n\\nPlay passes back to the US.\\n\\nThe US player can now move his remaining units. Tempest/102 \\n\\nmoves to 2912/WNW and Switchbox/106 to 3314/NW.

    "significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\n",
    "computation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
    "constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
    "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc\u0002tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
