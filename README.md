# Board_games_complexity
Project for Information_retrieval master course in computer science at universit√† degli studi di Milano.

Aim of the project is to try to predict a score (which is the weight used on BoardGamesGeeks) for the rulebooks of each game.
This project can be seen also as a way to predict language complexity.
