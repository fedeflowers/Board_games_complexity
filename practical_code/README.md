# Board_games_complexity
Project for Information_retrieval master course in computer science at universit√† degli studi di Milano.

Aim of the project is to try to predict a score (which is the weight used on BoardGamesGeeks) for the rulebooks of each game.
This project can be seen also as a way to predict language complexity.

The dataset with the rulebooks in pdf format, is too big to be pushed on Github, but anyway, it is not necesssary since all the extracted features are given, and the list of board games used is presented.
