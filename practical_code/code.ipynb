The second will teach you how to \\nuse the Scenario Book to link a series of adventures together to create a story of your own choosing, advancing \\nyour character’s abilities and unlocking new content to further enhance your experience.\\n\\nScenario Setup\\u2002pp.12–16\\n\\n\\n1. \\nScenario Page pp.12\\n–13\\n \\n\\n2. \\n\\nOverlay Tiles\\u2002pp.14–15\\n\\n\\n3. \\n\\nScenario Level\\u2002p.15\\n\\n\\n4. \\n\\nGame Variant: Open Information and \\nSolo Play\\u2002p.16\\n  \\n\\nRound Overview\\u2002pp.16–31\\n\\n\\n1. \\n\\nCard Selection\\u2002pp.16–17\\n\\n\\na. \\n\\nResting\\u2002p.17\\n\\n\\n2. \\n\\nDetermining Initiative\\u2002p.18\\n\\n\\n3. \\n\\nCharacter Turn\\u2002pp.18–28\\n\\n\\na. \\n\\nMove\\u2002p.19\\n\\n\\ni. \\n\\nRevealing a Room\\u2002p.19\\n\\n\\nb. \\n\\nAttack\\u2002pp.19–22\\n\\n\\ni. \\n\\nAdvantage and \\n\\nDisadvantage\\u2002pp.20–21\\n\\n\\nii. \\n\\nArea Effects\\u2002p.21\\n\\n\\niii. \\n\\nAttack Effects\\u2002p.22\\n\\nc. \\n\\nConditions\\u2002pp.22–23\\n\\nd. \\nElemental Infusions\\u2002pp.23–24\\n\\n\\ne. \\n\\nActive Bonuses\\u2002pp.25–26\\n\\n\\ni. \\n\\nShield\\u2002p.25\\n\\n\\nii. \\nRetaliate\\u2002p.26\\n\\n\\nf. \\n\\nHeal\\u2002p.26\\n\\n\\ng. \\n\\nSummon p.26\\n\\n\\nh. \\n\\nRecover and Refresh\\u2002p.27\\n\\n\\ni. \\n\\nLoot\\u2002p.27\\n\\n\\ni. \\n\\nEnd of Turn Looting\\u2002p.27\\n\\n\\nj. \\n\\nGaining Experience\\u2002pp.27–28\\n\\nk. \\nCharacter Damage\\u2002p.28\\n\\n\\nl. \\n\\nExhaustion\\u2002p.28\\n\\n\\nm. \\n\\nItems\\u2002p.28\\n\\n\\n4. \\n\\nMonster Turn\\u2002pp.29–32\\n\\na. \\n\\nOrder of Action\\u2002p.29\\n\\n\\nb. \\n\\nMonster Focus\\u2002pp.29–30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Mindthief\\n\\n\\n Spellweaver\\n\\n\\n Cragheart\\n\\n\\n Tinkerer\\n\\n\\n Scoundrel\\n\\n\\n Brute\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of round:\\nMonster actions:\\n\\n\\n\\nOn turn:Initiative [ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\nBB\\nBor\\n\\nAA\\nAChoose one pathStart of Round:\\nǱǱReduceǱelementǱstrength.ǱǱOptionalǱshortǱrest:ǱloseǱoneǱrandomǱdiscardǱandǱrecoverǱtheǱrest.ǱǱShuffleǱǱǱǱǱǱattackǱandǱmonsterǱdecksǱwhereǱapplicable.EliteǱfirst,ǱthenǱnormalǱinǱascendingǱnumericalǱorder.ǱFocusǱonǱǱǱǱǱǱclosest,ǱǱǱǱǱǱlowestǱinitiative.Ǳ ThenǱmoveǱtoǱmaximizeǱattackǱonǱfocus.LoseǱoneǱdiscardǱandǱrecoverǱtheǱrest,ǱHealǱǱǱǱǱ(self)ǱandrefreshǱǱǱǱǱǱspentǱitems.\\n2\\n99\\nPerformǱtopǱabilityǱofǱoneǱcardǱandǱbottomǱabilityǱofǱtheǱotherǱinǱanyǱorder.LeadingǱcardǱplayedRevealǱmonsterǱactions,ǱactǱinǱinitiativeǱ[ǱǱǱ]Ǳorder.\\nLongǱrestPlayǱ2Ǳcards \\n\\n12\\n9\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\nActive\\n\\n\\n\\nConditions\\n\\n\\nDiscard\\n\\n\\nLost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of round:\\nMonster actions:\\n\\n\\n\\nOn turn:Initiative [ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\nBB\\nBor\\n\\nAA\\nAChoose one pathStart of Round:\\nǱǱReduceǱelementǱstrength.ǱǱOptionalǱshortǱrest:ǱloseǱoneǱrandomǱdiscardǱandǱrecoverǱtheǱrest.ǱǱShuffleǱǱǱǱǱǱattackǱandǱmonsterǱdecksǱwhereǱapplicable.EliteǱfirst,ǱthenǱnormalǱinǱascendingǱnumericalǱorder.ǱFocusǱonǱǱǱǱǱǱclosest,ǱǱǱǱǱǱlowestǱinitiative.Ǳ ThenǱmoveǱtoǱmaximizeǱattackǱonǱfocus.LoseǱoneǱdiscardǱandǱrecoverǱtheǱrest,ǱHealǱǱǱǱǱ(self)ǱandrefreshǱǱǱǱǱǱspentǱitems.\\n2\\n99\\nPerformǱtopǱabilityǱofǱoneǱcardǱandǱbottomǱabilityǱofǱtheǱotherǱinǱanyǱorder.LeadingǱcardǱplayedRevealǱmonsterǱactions,ǱactǱinǱinitiativeǱ[ǱǱǱ]Ǳorder.\\nLongǱrestPlayǱ2Ǳcards \\n\\n12\\n10\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\nActive\\n\\n\\n\\nConditions\\n\\n\\nDiscard\\n\\n\\nLost\\n\\n\\n\\n Gain 7 or fewer \\nexperience \\npoints during the \\nscenario.Layabout\\n\\n\\n459\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n63\\nM-1\\n\\n\\n482\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayer ReferencePOISON - Extra damaged when \\nattacked and prevents healing. \\nRemove when healed.\\nWOUND - Suﬀ er damage at start of \\nturn.

These cards determine which \\nabilities each monster of that type—both normal and elite—will perform during the round on its turn.\\n\\n\\nA MONSTER ABILITY CARD INCLUDES:\\n\\n\\n• \\nThe name of the monster type\\u2003\\u2002. Sometimes, \\nmultiple monster types use the same, more \\ngeneric ability deck. For instance, Bandit Guards, \\nCity Guards, and Inox Guards all use the same \\n“Guard” deck.\\n \\n\\n• \\nAn initiative number\\u2003\\u2002. This number will \\ndetermine when every monster of that type will \\nact in a given round (see Determining Initiative on \\np. 18 for details).\\n  \\n\\n• \\nA list of abilities\\u2003\\u2002.

Checkmarks are used \\nto enhance a player’s attack modifier deck \\n(see Additional Perks on p. 44 for details). If \\nthe scenario resulted in failure, the character \\nreceives nothing from his or her battle goal card, \\nregardless of whether the goal was achieved. \\nPlayers can keep track of their battle goal \\nprogress using notes if necessary.

Players draw from the personal attack modifier \\ndeck for their chosen character and monsters draw from a collective monster deck. \\nThe modifier listed on the card is then applied to the attack, possibly reducing or \\n\\n\\nincreasing its numerical value.\\n\\n\\nThe value of the modifier for the attack\\u2003\\u2002. A “Null” symbol \\u2003\\u2002means that no damage is done by the attack. A \\n“2x” symbol \\u2003\\u2002means the attack value is doubled.\\nConditions, elemental infusions, or other special effects of the attack\\u2003\\u2002. If the attack modifier of the card \\nis +0, the special effect is shown in the center circle of the card\\u2003\\u2002. Otherwise, it is shown to the left of the \\nmodifier value\\u2003\\u2002. When these special effects are activated, they function exactly as if they had been written \\non the action card being used for the attack.\\nA rolling modifier symbol\\u2003\\u2002 indicates that an additional modifier card should be drawn. \\nModifier cards are then drawn until a rolling modifier is \\n\\n not\\n\\n revealed, at which point all the \\ndrawn modifiers are added together.\\nA special BLESS\\u2003\\u2002or CURSE\\u2003\\u2002border. If a BLESS or CURSE card is \\ndrawn, it should be \\n\\n removed\\n\\n from the player’s deck instead of being \\nplaced into the discard. Curse cards also have either a\\u2003\\u2002or an\\u2003\\u2002to \\ndenote whether they can be placed in the monster attack modifier \\ndeck\\u2003\\u2002, or a character's attack modifier deck\\u2003\\u2002.\\nA shuffle symbol\\u2003\\u2002. At the end of the round in which a “Null”\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002or “2x”\\u2003\\u2002\\u2003card is drawn \\nfrom a deck, players will shuffle all the played modifier cards back into that particular draw deck. \\nThis shuffling also happens if a modifier card must be drawn and there are none left in the draw \\n\\n\\npile.\\n\\n Add “PUSH 2” and the earth element effects to your attack, \\nthen increase your attack value by 2.\\n =\\n\\nA type icon\\u2003\\u2002.

Then read the introduction text and apply any negative \\nscenario effects from the “Special Rules” section. Next, two battle goals should be dealt to each player, one of \\nwhich will be discarded. Players can then decide which items they would like to equip from the collection of \\nitems they own (adding in -1 cards to their attack modifier decks when applicable). Next, players should decide \\nwhich ability cards they would like to put in their hand, choosing from the pool of those available to them. A \\nplayer must select a number of cards equal to his or her character’s hand size. When first starting the game, a \\nplayer’s hand should only consist of the set of \\n Level 1\\u2003\\u2003\\nability cards for the character’s class. Once a player \\nhas become familiar with the class, he or she can begin substituting out Level 1 cards for the more complex \\ncards with\\u2003\\u2003as the level. Once the character begins to level up, he or she will also get access to higher level \\ncards to add to his or her hand by pulling others out. After players select their hand, any effects of a preceding \\nroad event or city event are applied (see Traveling and Road Events on p. 41 for details).\\n\\n Scenario Setup\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nL1aG1bI1bMaps :\\n\\n\\n\\nTreasure \\nTile (x1)\\n\\n Bandit\\nArcher\\n\\n\\nTable (x2)\\n\\nBandit\\nGuard\\n\\nDamage\\nTrap (x2)\\n\\n\\nLiving\\nBones\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n07\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\nLinks: Barrow Lair – #2Black Barrow\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst StepsParty Achievement :\\n\\nBarrow Lair  2   (G-11)New Location :\\nWith the last bandit dead, you take a moment \\nto catch your breath and steel yourself against \\nthe visions of living remains ripping at your \\nflesh.

The specific map tiles \\nneeded for each scenario are also given\\u2003\\u2002. Each scenario map is broken up into separate rooms by \\ndoor overlay tiles. A room may contain more than one map tile if those tiles are connected by other \\n\\noverlay tiles.\\n\\n \\n\\n• \\nIndications used to populate the \\nscenario map\\u2003\\u2002based on the \\nmonster key\\u2003\\u2002. These indications \\nmay be in one of two different \\norientations depending on the \\noverall orientation of the map. \\nMonster placement is indicated \\nin a symbol’s upper left for two \\ncharacters, upper right for three \\ncharacters and bottom for four \\n\\ncharacters. \\n\\nBLACK\\n\\n means the \\n\\n\\nmonster is not present, \\n\\n WHITE\\n\\n \\n\\nmeans a normal monster is present, \\n\\nand \\n\\nGOLD \\n\\nmeans an elite monster \\n\\nis present. Normal monsters should \\nbe placed on the map with their \\ncorresponding standees in white \\nbases, and elite monsters should be \\nplaced in gold bases.\\n Example: \\n\\u2003\\u2003/\\u2003\\u2003 indicates which type of monster \\nis placed on this hex, and in this case no monster is \\nplaced in for two characters, a normal monster is \\nplaced for three characters, and an elite monster is \\nplaced for four characters.\\n\\nNote that only monsters in the starting room are placed at the beginning of a scenario. Monster \\nstandees each have a number to determine the order in which they act during the turn (see Order of \\nAction on p. 29 for details). The standee numbers should be randomized when placed.\\n\\n• \\nThe available starting character locations, depicted by \\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002.

A door acts as a separation between two rooms. When a character \\nmoves onto a closed door tile, they immediately flip over the door tile to the open \\nside, revealing the adjacent room tile. Immediately place overlay tiles, monsters, \\nand money tokens as indicated in the scenario description for the revealed room. \\nWhile closed doors do not hinder character movement at all, they act as a wall \\nfor any monsters or character-summoned figures, and figures cannot be forced \\nthrough a closed door. Open doors do not hinder any movement and cannot be \\nclosed. Door art varies by environment type, but they all function exactly the same.\\n  \\n\\n• \\n\\nCorridors\\u2003\\n\\n. A corridor is placed on the connection of two map tiles to cover the \\nwalls and create a single room out of multiple map tiles. Corridors act like normal \\n\\n\\nempty hexes.\\n \\n\\n• \\nTraps\\u2003\\n. A trap is sprung when a figure enters its hex with normal or forced \\nmovement. Flying\\u2003\\u2002and Jump\\u2003\\u2002movements are unaffected by traps. When a \\ntrap is sprung, it inflicts some negative effect on the figure who sprung it and then \\n\\nit is \\nremoved from the board\\n. A trap can also be disarmed through specific actions \\nto remove it from the board without suffering its negative effects. Trap effects are \\nvaried and are specified in the Scenario Book. If part of a trap’s effect is listed as \\n“damage,” the trap will inflict \\n 2+L damage \\non the affected figure, where L is the \\n\\n\\nscenario level\\n\\n. Characters and monsters can also create traps on the board, with \\nthe effects specified by the ability that creates the trap. Whenever a trap is placed \\non the board, tokens for the damage and effects the trap applies should be placed \\non top of the trap tile for easy reference.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nHazardous terrain\\u2003\\n. If a figure enters a hex with hazardous terrain via normal \\nor forced movement, each hex will inflict half the damage of a trap (rounded \\ndown). Flying\\u2003\\u2002and Jump\\u2003\\u2002movements are unaffected by hazardous terrain. \\nUnlike traps, hazardous terrain does not get removed after its effect is applied, but \\ninstead remains on the board indefinitely. Starting a turn on or exiting these hexes \\ndoes not cause additional damage.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nDifficult terrain\\u2003. \\nIt takes a figure two normal movement points to enter a hex \\n\\n\\nwith \\n\\ndifficult terrain. Flying\\u2003\\u2002, Jump\\u2003\\u2002, and forced movements are unaffected by \\ndifficult terrain. \\n  \\n\\n• \\nObstacles\\u2003\\n. Obstacles have varying artwork, but they all have the same function: \\nfigures cannot move through obstacles with a normal movement, but can move \\nthrough them with a Flying\\u2003\\u2002or Jump\\u2003\\u2002movement. \\n Obstacles do not hinder \\nranged attacks\\n. It is possible for certain character abilities to create or move \\nobstacles. When doing so, players can never completely cut off one area of the \\nscenario map from another, such that the area cannot be moved into without going \\n\\nthrough the obstacles.  \\n\\nOverlay Tiles\\n\\n\\nA scenario is constructed from a set of map tiles as instructed in the Scenario Book. Additionally, there will be \\nspecial overlay tiles to fill out the encounter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', ' 15\\n\\n• \\n\\nTreasure\\u2003\\n\\n. Treasure tiles can be looted by a player (see Loot on p. 27 for \\n details) \\n\\nfor a variety of effects. There are two types of treasure tiles: “goal” tiles and \\nnumbered tiles. Goal tiles are important for the completion of a scenario, and \\nthe rules for looting them will be specified by the scenario. “Goal” tiles are reset \\nevery time a scenario is played. Numbered tiles can provide a number of different \\nbenefits. When one is looted, the looting player should immediately reference \\nthe number of the tile with the treasure index in the back of the scenario book \\nto discover what was looted.  If a \\n specific item name \\nis listed, find this item in \\nthe deck of unique items and immediately add it to your pool of items. If an \\n item \\ndesign \\nis listed, find all copies of that item and add them to the city’s available \\n\\n\\nsupply. \\n\\nNumbered treasure tiles can only be looted once\\n . After they have been \\nlooted, they should be crossed off in the Scenario Book as a reminder.\\n\\nMonster base statistics\\n, \\ntrap damage\\n, the \\namount of gold received from money tokens, \\n and the \\namount of \\nbonus experience for completing a scenario\\n  are all dependent on the level of the scenario being played. The \\n\\n\\nscenario level \\n\\nis chosen by the players before the scenario begins and is based on the average level of the \\nparty and how difficult the players want the scenario to be.\\n\\n Scenario Level\\n 00224\\n11236\\n22348\\n333510\\n444612\\n554714\\n665816\\n776918\\n\\nScenario \\nlevelMonster \\nlevelGold \\nconversionTrap\\ndamageBonus \\nexperience\\n\\n\\n Easy\\n-1\\nNormal +0\\nHard +1\\nVery Hard +2\\n\\nDifficulty\\n\\nLevel modification\\n\\nA scenario’s level can be set to any number from 0 to \\n7, but cannot be changed once the scenario begins. \\n\\n\\nThe \\n\\nrecommended\\n\\n scenario level is equal to the \\n\\naverage level of the characters in the party, divided by \\n2 and rounded up; this would be considered “Normal” \\ndifficulty. If players desire an “Easy” experience, they \\ncan reduce the recommended scenario level by 1. If a \\nmore difficult experience is desired, the scenario level \\ncan be raised by 1 for “Hard” or 2 for “Very Hard.”\\n\\nExample:\\n \\nIf a party contains a Level 6 character, two Level 4 characters, and a Level 3 character, the average \\nwould be 4.25; divided by 2 and rounded up is 3, so a normal scenario difficulty level would be 3. The choice of \\nscenario level is completely up to the players. Higher scenario levels will result in more difficult monsters, but will \\nalso yield more gold and experience.\\n\\n', '16\\nRound Overview\\n\\n\\nA scenario consists of a series of \\n\\n rounds\\n\\n that are played until players either meet the victory conditions of the \\nscenario or fail the scenario. A round consists of the following steps:\\n\\n1. Card selection: \\nEach player will either select two cards from his or her hand to play or declare he or she \\n\\nis performing a \\nlong rest action \\nfor the round.\\n  \\n\\n2. \\nDetermining initiative: \\n\\nPlayers reveal their cards for the round, and an ability card for each monster \\ntype currently in play is also revealed. An\\n  \\ninitiative order is then determined based on the initiative \\nvalues of these revealed cards.\\n  \\n\\n\\n3. \\n\\nCharacter and monster turns: \\n\\nStarting with the lowest initiative, players and monsters will act out their \\n\\n\\nturns\\n\\n, performing the actions on their cards, possibly modified by character item cards.\\n  \\n\\n\\n4. \\nCleanup: \\n\\nSome cleanup may be required at the end of the round (see End of Round on p. 32 for details).\\n\\n\\nCard Selection\\n\\n\\nAt the beginning of a round, each player will secretly select two cards from his or her hand to play facedown in \\nfront of them. Of the two cards, one should be selected as the \\n leading card, \\n\\nwhich\\n\\n \\nwill determine the player’s \\norder in the initiative for the round (see Determining Initiative on p. 18 for details).\\n\\n Game Variant: Open Information and Solo Play\\n\\n\\nA single player can play the game as \\na solo experience by controlling two \\nor more characters at once. Part of \\n\\nthe game’s difficulty, however, comes \\n\\nfrom not knowing exactly what the \\n\\nother characters will be doing on their \\n\\nturn. Because a solo player has precise \\n\\ninformation about what each character \\nis doing and can coordinate more \\neffectively, the game becomes easier. \\nTo compensate for this, solo players \\n\\nshould \\n\\nincrease the monster level and \\n\\ntrap damage by 1 for any given scenario \\n\\nwithout increasing gold conversion and \\n\\n\\nbonus experience\\n\\n. \\n\\nAdditionally, if they wish, a group of players may also play with fully open information by increasing the \\ndifficulty in the same way as for solo play. Playing with open information means that players can share the \\nexact contents of their hands and discuss specific details about what they plan on doing. \\n This is not the \\n\\nrecommended way to play the game\\n , but it may be desirable for certain groups.\\n 01234\\n12246\\n23358\\n343610\\n454712\\n564814\\n675916\\n Scenario \\nlevelMonster \\nlevelGold \\nconversionTrap\\ndamageBonus \\nexperience\\n', ' 17\\n\\nDuring a player’s turn, the two played cards will be used to perform actions and then are \\n\\n\\neither \\n\\ndiscarded\\n, \\n\\nlost\\n\\n,\\n \\n\\nor \\n\\nactivated\\n\\n, depending on the actions that were taken. Played \\ncards are normally placed in a player’s \\n discard pile \\n\\nunless otherwise noted. \\n\\nDiscarded\\n \\n\\ncards can be returned to a player’s \\n\\n hand\\n\\n through \\n\\nresting\\n\\n (see below). If the performed \\naction from a card contains a\\u2003\\u2003symbol in the lower right of the action field, the card \\nis instead placed in a player’s \\n lost pile\\n. \\n\\nLost \\n\\ncards\\n\\n \\ncan only be returned to a player’s hand \\nduring a scenario by using a special \\n\\n recover\\n\\n action. Whether the corresponding card is \\nlost or discarded, some actions may contain an\\n\\n  active\\n\\n effect (denoted by the symbols at \\nright). Instead of being placed in the discard or lost pile, the card is placed in the \\n\\n active \\n\\n\\narea \\n\\nin front of the player to keep track of the effect. Once the effect wears off, the card \\nis then transferred to the appropriate pile (see Active Bonuses on pp. 25–26 for details).\\n\\n\\nPlayers \\n\\nmust\\n\\n either play two cards from their hand or declare a \\n long rest action \\nat the \\n\\nbeginning of \\n\\nevery\\n\\n round. If a player only has one card or no cards in their hand, the \\nlong rest action is their only option. If this option is \\n\\n also\\n\\n not available at the beginning \\n\\n\\nof a round because a player has only one card or no cards in their discard pile as well, \\nthat player is considered \\n\\n exhausted\\n\\n and can no longer participate in the scenario (see \\nExhaustion on p. 28 for details).\\n\\n\\nRESTING\\n\\n\\n• \\n\\nShort rest\\n\\n: During the cleanup step of a round, a player can perform a short rest. This allows that player \\nto immediately shuffle his or her discard pile and \\n\\n randomly\\n\\n place one of the cards in the lost pile, then \\nreturn the rest of the discarded cards to his or her hand. If the player would like to instead \\n\\n keep\\n\\n the \\n\\n\\ncard that was randomly lost, he or she can choose to suffer 1 damage and \\n\\n randomly\\n\\n lose a \\n\\ndifferent\\n\\n \\n\\ndiscarded card, but this can only be done once per rest.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nLong rest\\n: A long rest is declared during the card selection step of a round and constitutes the player’s \\nentire turn for the round. Resting players are considered to have an initiative value of 99. On the \\nplayer’s turn, at the end of the initiative order, he or she must \\n\\n choose\\n\\n to lose one of his or her discarded \\ncards, then return the rest of the discarded cards to his or her hand. The resting character also \\n\\nperforms a “Heal\\u2003\\u20022, Self” action\\n and \\nrefreshes all of his or her spent item cards\\n .\\nPlayers should not show other players the cards in their hands nor give specific information about \\n\\n any \\n\\n\\nnumerical value or title\\n on any of their cards. They are, however, allowed to make general statements about \\ntheir actions for the round and discuss strategy.\\n\\n• \\nExamples of appropriate communication: \\n “I’m attacking this guard near the middle of the round.”; \\n“I’m planning on moving here and healing you pretty early in the round, hopefully before the monsters \\n\\nattack.”\\n\\n \\n\\n• \\nExamples of inappropriate communication: \\n “You’ll need lower than an initiative 17 to go before me.”; \\n“I should be doing 4 points of damage to the bandit, so you don’t have to worry about him.”; “I’m going \\nto use Impaling Eruption and wipe out everyone.”\\n  \\n\\nResting is the main way players can return discarded cards back into their hand of available cards. A player has \\ntwo options when resting: a \\n\\n short rest\\n\\n or a \\nlong rest\\n. In both cases, the rest action can \\n\\n only\\n\\n be taken if a player \\n\\nhas two or more cards in his or her discard pile, and a rest action \\n\\n always\\n\\n results in losing one of the discarded \\n\\ncards.\\n\\n Lost\\n\\nRecover\\nPersistent \\n\\nBonus\\n\\nRound Bonus\\n\\n\\nActive Effects', '18\\nCharacter Turn\\n\\n\\nOn a character’s turn, he or she will perform the \\n\\n top\\n\\n action of one of the two ability cards played and the \\n\\n\\nbottom\\n\\n action of the other. The \\n\\n leading card \\n\\ndesignation used to determine initiative is \\n no longer significant\\n . \\n\\nEither card can be played first for its top or bottom action. When playing a card’s action, the abilities of the \\naction must be done in the order written and can’t be interrupted by the action on the other card. As soon \\nas the action of a card is completed, it is immediately placed in the appropriate area (discard pile, lost pile, or \\nactive area) before anything else happens. Players are typically free to choose not to perform any part of the \\naction on their card, however, they \\n\\n must\\n\\n perform any part that will cause a negative effect (e.g., reduce hit \\npoints, lose cards, or cause a negative condition) on themselves or their allies. \\n\\nAn \\n\\nally\\n\\n is any figure that fights with a character. This term includes summoned \\nfigures, but does not include the character itself. Abilities cannot affect allies \\nunless the card or rules specify otherwise.\\n\\nPlayers can also use \\nany card they play \\n\\n as an \\n\\n“Attack 2” \\n\\naction \\n\\n\\non the \\n\\ntop\\n\\n half or a \\n“Move 2” \\naction on the \\n\\nbottom\\n\\n. If a card is \\nused this way, it is always discarded, regardless of what is printed \\non the card.  On their turn, before, during, or after performing \\ntheir two actions, players can use any number of items they have \\n\\nequipped.\\n\\nDetermining Initiative\\n\\n\\nAfter players have either selected their two action cards or declared a long rest, the players reveal a monster \\nability card for each type of monster that has at least one figure currently on the map. In addition, each player \\nnot taking a long rest reveals his or her selected cards\\n  \\nfor the round, placing their \\n\\n leading card\\n\\n on top so that \\n\\nits initiative value is visible.\\n\\nInitia\\ntive order is determined by comparing the initiative values on all played monster ability cards and all of \\nthe players’ leading cards. Whoever has the lowest initiative value takes their turn first, then the next highest, \\nand so on until every figure on the board has acted. When a monster type takes an action, each monster \\nof that type will perform the actions listed on their played ability card, starting with elites and then normal \\nmonsters in ascending standee order. \\n  \\n\\nIf th\\n\\nere is ever a tie in initiative between players, consult the non-leading card of each player to break the tie. \\n(If there is still a tie, players should decide among themselves who goes first.) If there is a tie between a player \\nand a monster type, the player goes first. If there is a tie between two monster types, the players decide which \\ngoes first.\\n\\n\\nExa\\nmple:\\n \\nAt the start of the round, the Brute \\ndecides that he wishes to play the two cards \\nshown. He also decides he wants to go late in the \\nround, so he choses the “61” as his leading card. If \\nhe had wanted to go early, he could have chosen \\nthe “15” as the leading card. The Scoundrel reveals \\na leading card with “86” initiative, and the played \\nLiving Bones and Bandit Archer monster ability \\ncards have “45” and “32” initiative respectively. \\nThe Bandit Archers activate first, then all of the \\nLiving Bones, then the Brute, and finally the \\n\\n\\nScoundrel.\\n\\n Shield      1\\nSelf\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack 4\\nSTUN     -\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n151\\nShield Bash\\n\\n\\n008\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShield      1\\nSelf\\n\\n\\nAttack 4\\nSTUN     -\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n151\\nShield Bash\\n\\n\\n008\\n\\nShield      1\\nSelf\\n\\n\\nAttack 4\\nSTUN     -\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n151\\nShield Bash\\n\\n\\n008\\n\\nShield      1\\nSelf\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack 4\\nSTUN     -\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n151\\nShield Bash\\n\\n\\n008\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next time you suﬀ er damage this \\nround, suﬀ er no damage instead.\\n\\nAdd +X Attack   where X is double\\nthe Shield value of the target.Attack  2\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n09XTrickster’s Reversal\\n\\n\\n098\\n\\n\\n\\nMove 3\\nPUSH        2\\nTarget one adjacent enemy\\n\\n\\nAttack 6\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n611Overwhelming Assault\\n\\n\\n005\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn your next four attacks targeting enemies \\nadjacent to none of their allies, add +2 Attack      .\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n1\\n\\nAttack  3\\nAdd +2 Attack   and gain       when the \\ntarget is adjacent to any of your allies.\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n861Single Out\\n\\n\\n088\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMove+ 0\\nAttack+ 1\\n\\n\\nRange            - 1\\n\\n32\\n\\nArcher\\n\\n\\n534\\n\\n\\n\\nMove+ 0\\nAttack+ 0\\n\\n45\\n\\nLiving Bones\\n\\n\\n519\\n\\nInitiative Icon\\n\\n\\n\\n', ' 19\\n\\nMOVE\\n\\nATTACK\\n\\nA \\n“Move X” \\nability allows a character to move \\n up to\\n X number of hexes on the map. Figures \\n\\n(characters and monsters) can move through allies, but cannot move through enemies or \\nobstacles. Traps and other terrain effects of hexes must be resolved when a figure enters them \\nwith normal movement. A figure cannot end its movement in the same hex as another figure. \\n\\n\\nFigures can \\n\\nnever\\n\\n move through walls.\\n\\n\\nSome Move abilities are specified as a “Jump.” \\n Move X (Jump) \\n allows the character to ignore \\n\\nall figures and terrain effects during their movement. However, the last hex of a jump is still \\nconsidered a normal movement, and so must obey the normal movement rules above.\\nSome figures may also have the \\n “Flying” \\nspecial trait. This allows figures to completely ignore \\nany figures and terrain tiles during any part of their movement, including the last hex, \\n\\n except\\n\\n \\n\\nthat they still must end their movement in an \\n\\n unoccupied\\n\\n hex (no figures present). This includes \\nforced movement like PUSH or PULL. If a figure loses its Flying trait while occupying an obstacle \\nhex, it takes damage as if it had sprung a damage trap and then moves immediately to the \\n\\n\\nnearest \\n\\nempty\\n\\n hex (no figures, tokens, or overlay tiles of any kind present except corridors, \\npressure plates, and open doors).\\n\\nRanged attacks \\nare accompanied by a \\n“Range Y” \\nvalue, which means any enemy within Y \\nhexes can be targeted by the attack. Any ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy gains \\nDisadvantage against that target (see Advantage and Disadvantage on pp. 20–21 for details).\\n  \\n\\nMelee attacks \\nhave no accompanying range value and are considered to have a default \\n  \\n\\nrange of 1 hex, which means they typically target adjacent enemies.\\n\\n\\nLine-of-sight:\\n\\n All ranged and melee attacks can only be performed against enemies within \\nline-of-sight, which means that a line can be drawn from any corner of the attacker’s hex to any \\ncorner of the defender’s hex without touching any part of a wall (the line edge of a map tile \\nor the entire area of any partial hex along the edge of a map tile, unless covered by an overlay \\ntile). Only walls block line-of-sight. In addition, \\n any ability\\n which specifies a range can only be \\nperformed on a figure within line-of-sight. If a non-attack ability does not specify a range, \\nthen line-of-sight is not required. Also note that two hexes separated by a wall line are not \\nconsidered adjacent, and range cannot be counted through walls.\\n  \\n\\nREVEALING A ROOM\\n\\n\\nDuring any part of a character’s movement, if they enter a tile with a closed door, flip the door tile to the \\nopened side and immediately reveal the adjacent room on the other side of the door. The Scenario Book will \\nthen specify what monsters, money tokens, and special overlay tiles should be placed in the revealed room, \\nbased on the number of characters (including exhausted characters). Note that, as in scenario setup, the \\nstandee numbers of the monsters in the new room should be randomized when placed. It is possible to run out \\nof specific types of monster standees when revealing a room. If this happens, place only the standees that are \\navailable, starting with the monsters closest to the revealing character.\\nOnce everything is placed in the new room, any present monster types without an action card should have one \\ndrawn for them now. Once the revealing character’s turn ends, the initiative values of all monsters in the new \\nroom are reviewed, and any monster type that has a lower initiative value than the revealing character (i.e., \\nthey should have acted earlier in the round) must immediately act out their turn (in normal initiative order in \\ncase of multiple monster types in this situation). This ensures that all monsters revealed in the new room will \\n\\n\\nalways\\n\\n take a turn in the round in which they are revealed.\\n\\nAn \\n“Attack X” \\nability allows a character to do a base X amount of damage to an enemy within \\ntheir range. Figures cannot attack their allies. There are two types of attacks: \\n ranged\\n and \\n\\nmelee\\n\\n.', '20\\n\\nADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE\\n\\n\\nSome attacks may have either \\n\\n Advantage\\n\\n or \\n\\nDisadvantage\\n.\\n\\n• \\nAn attacker with \\n\\nAdvantage\\n\\n will draw two modifier cards from their \\ndeck and use whichever one is \\n better\\u2003\\u2002\\n. If one rolling modifier card \\nwas drawn, its effect is added to the other card played\\u2003\\u2002. If two rolling \\nmodifier cards were drawn, continue to draw cards until a rolling modifier \\nis not drawn and then add together all drawn effects\\u2003\\u2002. \\n  \\n\\n• \\nAn attacker with \\n Disadvantage\\n will draw two modifier cards from \\ntheir deck and use whichever one is \\n worse\\u2003\\u2002\\n. Rolling modifiers are \\ndisregarded in the case of Disadvantage\\u2003\\u2002. If two rolling modifier cards \\nwere drawn, continue to draw cards until a rolling modifier is not played \\nand then only apply the effect of the last card drawn\\u2003\\u2002. \\n  +++\\nWhen attacking, the base attack value written on the card can be modified by three types of values in the \\nfollowing order. Repeat these steps for each individual enemy targeted by the attack:\\n  \\n\\n• \\nAn \\n\\nattacker’s attack modifiers\\n\\n are applied first. These modifiers include bonuses and penalties from \\nactive ability cards, items, and other sources (e.g., +1 Attack from POISON).\\n  \\n\\n• \\nNext, an \\nattack modifier card \\nis drawn from the attacker’s attack modifier deck and applied.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nL\\n\\nastly, the \\n\\ndefender’s defensive bonuses\\n  are applied. This reduces the incoming attack value for each \\nindividual enemy targeted based on each defender’s own shield modifier or other defensive bonuses.\\n  \\n\\n• \\n\\nIf \\n\\nthere are multiple modifiers in any single step of this process, the player chooses the order in which \\nthey are applied. Also note that because the bonuses are applied \\n per target\\n, it is possible for the same \\nattack action to ultimately deal different damage to each enemy it targets.\\n  \\n\\nExample:\\n \\nThe Scoundrel performs an “Attack 3” ability on an adjacent elite Bandit Guard. The Scoundrel adds a \\n+2 attack modifier because of specific conditions set by the card and also is allowed to double the attack because \\nof an active card in front of her. She chooses to add the +2, then doubles the result, resulting in an “Attack 10.” \\nShe then plays an attack modifier card to reveal a “-1,” so the attack is reduced to 9. Finally, the Bandit Guard \\nhas a shield value of 1, so the attack value is reduced to 8 and the bandit suffers 8 damage.\\n\\nAny damage suffered by a monster should be tracked on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding to the \\nnumber on the specific monster’s standee. When a monster is brought to zero or fewer hit points by an attack \\nor any source of damage, that monster immediately dies and is removed from the board. Any additional effects \\nof an attack are not applied once a monster dies.\\n\\nWhen a monster dies, a money token is also placed on the hex where it died if the monster was not \\nsummoned or spawned\\n .\\n\\n\\n\\n2/2\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring your attack, gain Advantage on the entire Attack action.Eagle-Eye Goggles30\\n\\n\\n759\\n\\nExample of an ability \\n\\ngiving Advantage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nb\\n\\ne\\n c\\n\\nfe\\nfa\\nb\\nc\\n\\nd', ' 21\\n\\nAREA EFFECTS\\n\\n\\nSome attacks and other abilities allow figures to target multiple hexes or multiple targets at the same time. In \\nthese cases, the area of effect for the ability is shown on the ability card\\n . Note that any rotational orientation \\nof the depicted diagram is valid. Also note that each target constitutes a separate \\n\\n attack \\n\\n(drawing its own \\nattack modifier card), but all attacks together make up a single \\n\\n attack action\\n\\n.\\n \\n\\nSome attacks are accompanied by a “Target X” value, which means the character can target X \\nnumber of different enemies within the attack’s range with the attack.If there is ambiguity about which card drawn is better or worse, use whichever card was drawn first. Ambiguity \\ncan occur when comparing one or more added effects provided by attack modifier cards (e.g., elemental \\ninfusions, negative conditions, etc.) All added effects should be considered to have a positive but undefined \\n\\n\\nnumerical value.\\nInsta\\n\\nnces of Advantage and Disadvantage are mostly gained by specific character or monster abilities. However, \\nany ranged attack targeting an adjacent enemy also gains Disadvantage for that target. Instances of Advantage \\nor Disadvantage don’t stack, and if an attack has instances of both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel \\nout each other and the attack is performed normally.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMove       4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack       4\\nRange       3\\nGain           for each\\nenemy targeted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n741\\n\\n\\nInk Bomb\\n\\n034\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Shield      1\\nAffect self and all adjacent allies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttack       3\\nWOUND\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n471\\n\\n\\nFlamethrower\\n\\n\\n032\\nExample:\\n \\nThis attack indicates that the \\nfigure can perform a ranged “Attack 4” on \\na cluster of three hexes as long as \\n at least \\none of those hexes is within Range 3.

An area \\nattack which includes a grey hex is always considered a melee attack.\\n  \\n\\nRed indicates the hexes with enemies affected by the ability.\\n  \\n\\nFor a ranged area attack, only one of the red hexes needs to be within the range specified, and it does not \\nneed to contain an enemy. However, for both ranged and melee area attacks, \\n you can only attack enemies \\nin hexes you have line of sight to.\\n\\nFor any attack that targets multiple enemies, an attack modifier card is drawn for \\n\\n each target\\n\\n. It is not possible \\n\\nto target the same enemy with multiple attacks from the same ability. \\n Note: \\nAbilities can \\n\\nnever\\n\\n target allies \\n\\n\\n(positive abilities meant for allies will use the term “affect” instead of “target”). An ally can be within the \\naffected area of an attack, but \\n they will not be targeted by it\\n . \\n\\nNote also that as long as an attack does not specify range, it is considered melee, such that it is possible to \\nattack a non-adjacent target with a melee attack if hex configuration allows.\\n\\n\\n\\n a\\nba\\nb', '22\\n\\nATTACK EFFECTS\\n\\n\\nAttack abilities will often have effects that increase their power. If an attack effect is listed on an ability card \\nafter an attack, the target (or targets) of the attack is subject to the additional effect as well, after damage \\nfrom the attack is resolved. \\n Attack effects are applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does \\n\\ndamage. \\n\\nThese effects (except experience gains) are optional and can be skipped. Some character actions can \\nalso apply these effects without an attack, and in such cases the target of the effect is written on the ability \\n\\ncard. \\n\\n\\nPUSH X\\n – The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each \\nhex moved must place the target \\n farther away from \\nthe attacker than it was previously. If there \\nare no viable hexes into which to push the target, the push ends. The target can be pushed \\nthrough its allies, but not its enemies.\\n  \\n\\n\\nPU\\nLL X \\n– The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex \\nmoved must place the target \\n closer to \\nthe attacker than it was previously. If there are no viable \\nhexes into which to pull the target, the pull ends. The target can be pulled through its allies, but \\nnot its enemies. Both push and pull effects are considered movements, however, they are not \\naffected by difficult terrain.\\n  \\n\\n\\nPIE\\nRCE X \\n– Up to X points of the target’s Shield are ignored for the attack. Unlike other effects, \\nPIERCE is applied while calculating the accompanying attack damage instead of afterwards.\\n  \\n\\nExample:\\n \\nan Attack 3 PIERCE 2 ability used on a monster with Shield 3 would ignore two of \\nthe monster’s Shield points and inflict 2 damage (modified by an attack modifier card).\\n\\n\\nADD TARGET\\n\\n – If a figure triggers this effect with an attack action, the figure may add an \\nadditional target within range to their attack. All added effects and conditions of the attack action \\nare applied to the target, as well, except for effects that would result in additional targets outside \\nof the original added target (e.g., area attacks).  \\n\\nPOISON\\n – If a figure is poisoned, all enemies add +1 Attack to all of their attacks targeting the \\nfigure. If a Heal ability is used on a poisoned figure, the POISON token is removed, and the Heal \\nhas no other effect.\\n  \\n\\n\\nWOUND\\n\\n – If a figure is wounded, it suffers one point of damage at the start of each of its turns. If \\na Heal ability is used on a wounded figure, the WOUND token is removed and the Heal continues \\nnormally. If a figure is both poisoned and wounded, a Heal ability would remove both conditions \\nbut have no other effect.\\n  \\n\\n\\nIMMOBILIZE\\n\\n – If a figure is immobilized, it cannot perform any \\n\\n move\\n\\n abilities on its turn. At the \\nend of its next turn, the IMMOBILIZE token is removed.\\n  \\n\\nCONDITIONS\\n\\n\\nCertain abilities may apply conditions to their targets. When a condition is applied to a figure (except CURSE \\nand BLESS), the respective token is placed on the stat sleeve in the section corresponding the number on the \\nspecific monster’s standee to signify the effect. The condition remains on the figure until the requirements for \\nremoving the specific effect are met. Only one of each condition type may be applied to any single figure at a \\ntime, however conditions can be reapplied to refresh their duration.\\n\\n\\nThe following are \\n\\nnegative conditions\\n\\n. If an ability has the name of one of these conditions contained within it, \\nthen the condition is applied to all targets of the ability, after the main effect of the ability is applied. Conditions \\nare applied regardless of whether the corresponding attack does damage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', \" 23\\n\\nCURSE\\n\\n – If a figure is cursed, it must shuffle a CURSE card into its remaining \\nattack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure’s \\nattacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack \\nmodifier discard pile. Note that there are two separate curse decks: 10 cards \\nwith a\\u2003\\u2002in the lower left corner and 10 cards with an\\u2003\\u2002. \\u2003\\u2002cards can only \\nbe placed in the monster attack deck (when a monster is cursed), and\\u2003\\u2002cards can only be placed \\nin a character's attack deck (when a character or character summon is cursed). Thus, a maximum \\nof only 10 curse cards can be placed into any one deck.\\n  \\n\\n\\nINVISIBLE\\n\\n – If a figure is invisible, it cannot be focused on or targeted by an enemy. Invisibility does \\nnot affect a figure’s interactions with his or her allies. At the end of its next turn, the INVISIBLE \\ntoken is removed. Monsters treat invisible characters exactly as if they were obstacles.\\n  \\n\\n\\nSTRENGTHEN \\n\\n– If a figure is strengthened, it gains Advantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its \\nnext turn, the STRENGTHEN token is removed.\\n  \\n\\nDISARM\\n\\n – If a figure is disarmed, it cannot perform any \\n\\n attack\\n\\n abilities on its turn. At the end of its \\nnext turn, the DISARM token is removed.\\n  \\n\\n\\nSTUN\\n\\n – If a figure is stunned, it cannot perform \\n\\n any\\n\\n abilities or use items on its turn \\n except to \\nperform a long rest \\n(in the case of characters). At the end of its next turn, the STUN token is \\nremoved. Players must still play two cards or rest on their turn, and if a player plays two cards \\nwhile stunned, the actions played are not used, and the cards are simply discarded.\\n  \\n\\n\\nMUDDLE\\n\\n – If a figure is muddled, it gains Disadvantage on all of its attacks. At the end of its next \\nturn, the MUDDLE token is removed.\\n  \\n\\n\\nBLESS\\n\\n – If a figure is blessed, it must shuffle a BLESS card into its remaining \\nattack modifier deck. When this card is revealed through one of the figure’s \\nattacks, it is removed from the deck instead of being placed into the attack \\nmodifier discard pile.\\n\\n\\nELEMENTAL INFUSIONS\\n\\n\\nSome abilities have an elemental affinity associated with them (either \\n\\n Fire\\n\\n, \\nIce\\n, \\n\\nAir\\n\\n, \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n, \\n\\nLight\\n\\n,\\n \\n\\nor\\n\\n Dark\\n\\n). If \\nany of these symbols is visible by itself in an action’s description\\u2003\\u2002, it means that by performing any part \\nof the action, the figure must infuse the battlefield with that element. This is represented by moving the \\ncorresponding element’s token to the “Strong” column of the elemental infusion table \\n at the end of the turn\\n\\n  in \\n\\n\\nwhich the ability was used.\\n\\nThe following are \\n\\npositive conditions\\n\\n.

This augment is represented by an elemental \\nsymbol covered with a red\\u2003\\u2002\\u2003\\u2002, followed by a colon and \\nhow the ability is augmented if the element is consumed. If an \\nability is used that consumes an element and the corresponding \\nelement token is in the Strong or Waning column, that element \\n\\n\\ntoken \\n\\nmay\\n\\n be used to augment the ability by moving the token to \\nthe Inert column. A single icon cannot be used to consume more \\nthan one infusion, and \\n it is not possible to create an element \\n\\nand consume it on the same turn\\n, but it may be consumed by \\nanyone with a later turn in the initiative order of the same round. \\nIf an ability contains multiple separate augments, the player may \\nchoose which augments to use in any order. If a single augment \\nlists multiple element uses, all elements must be used to activate \\n\\n\\nthe augment.\\n\\n\\nJust like characters, monsters also have the ability to create \\nand consume elements. Monsters always consume elements if \\nthey can, and every activated monster of that type will gain the \\nbenefit of the consumed element, not just the first monster to \\n\\n\\nconsume it. \\n \\n\\nThis multi-colored circle represents \\n\\n any single one \\n\\nof the six elements.

Then each time \\nafterward that she normally would suffer 1 or \\nmore points of damage, the bonus is applied, \\nthe damage is negated, and the token is moved \\nforward one space. Once the token moves twice, \\nthe card is moved to the player’s lost pile and the \\nbonus is no longer active.\\n\\nACTIVE BONUSES\\n\\n\\nSome abilities can give a character, or his or her allies, bonuses on other abilities, either \\n\\n persistently\\n\\n until \\n\\ncertain conditions are fulfilled \\n\\n or\\n\\n for the rest of the \\n\\n round\\n\\n. These abilities are denoted with symbols, and the \\ncards with these effects are played into the \\n\\n active\\n\\n \\n\\narea \\n\\nin front of the player to keep track of these bonuses.\\n\\nPersistent bonuses\\n can be identified by the symbol\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003displayed on the card. These ability effects will be \\nactive from the time the card is played until the conditions specified on the card are met. These conditions \\nusually track the number of times a particular game event has occurred, such as making or defending against an \\nattack. Place a token on the first marked position of the card’s action and advance it one space each time the \\neffect is triggered, left to right, top to bottom. When the ability has been used once for each space on the card, \\nremove the card from play by placing it in the lost pile. Players \\n\\n must\\n\\n use the benefits of a persistent bonus \\nwhen possible, even if no benefit is gained. If there are no conditions specified or positions marked, the card \\nmay remain in the player’s active area for the rest of the scenario and can be removed from play at any time by \\n\\nplacing it in the lost pile.\\n\\nRound bonuses \\nwill have this symbol\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003on the card. The effect of the ability will be active from the time \\nthe card is played until the end of the round, at which point the card will be placed in the player’s discard or \\nlost pile (depending on whether the action also contains an\\u2003\\u2002symbol).\\nEven though a bonus card is placed in the active area, it is still considered \\n discarded\\n\\n or \\n\\nlost,\\n\\n depending on \\nwhether the action also contains an\\u2003\\u2002 symbol.

Summoned \\nfigures (summons) are placed in an empty hex adjacent to the \\nfigure performing the summon. If there are no available hexes, the \\nsummon ability cannot be used. Summons are represented by a \\ncolored summon token. There are eight different colors of summon \\ntokens so that multiple summons can be tracked at the same time, \\nand players can assign any color they like to a specific summon, \\nplacing tracker tokens on their summon ability cards for easy \\n\\n\\nreference. \\n\\n\\nSummons have basic statistics for hit points, attack value, move \\nvalue, and range value along with any special traits written on the \\nability card. A summon is considered a persistent bonus (the card \\nis placed in the active area) until either the summon loses all its hit \\npoints, its corresponding ability card is removed from the active \\narea, or the summoner becomes exhausted, at which point the \\nsummon is removed from the board. \\nA summon’s turn in the initiative order is always \\n directly before the \\n\\ncharacter who summoned it\\n, and is separate from that character’s \\nturn. Summons are not controlled by the summoning player, but \\ninstead obey automated monster rules, permanently following the \\nability card \\n“Move+0, Attack+0” \\n(see Monster Turn on pp. 29–32 \\nfor details) and using the player’s attack modifier deck to perform \\nits attacks. \\nA player can have multiple different summon abilities in play \\nat once, in which case they act in the order in which they were \\n\\nsummoned. Summoned figures \\n\\nnever\\n\\n take a turn in the round they \\nare summoned. Summon kills are credited to the owner of the \\n\\n\\nsummon.\\n\\nA “Retaliate X” bonus ability causes the recipient to inflict X points of damage on figures who \\nattack it from an adjacent hex for each attack made. A retaliate bonus can also be accompanied \\nby a “Range Y” value, which means that the retaliate damage is applied to any attacker within Y \\nhexes. A retaliate takes effect after the attack that initiated it. If the retaliating figure is killed or \\nexhausted by the attack, then the retaliate does not activate. Multiple retaliate bonuses stack \\nwith one another, and retaliate itself is not an attack or even a targeted effect.\\nA “Heal X” ability allows a figure to return X hit points to either themselves or one ally within the \\nability’s range.  Heals are always accompanied by one of two labels:\\n  \\n\\n• \\n“Range Y” \\nmeans that any ally within Y hexes, or the figure performing the heal, can be \\naffected by the heal. Like all ranged abilities, the recipient must be in line-of-sight.\\n  \\n\\n• \\n\\n“Self”\\n\\n mean the figure can only affect him or herself with the heal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMove       4\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n: -: 1\\n: 2: 6\\nSummon Rat Swarm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOISON\\n\\n2\\n2\\n\\n\\n821\\nGnawing Horde\\n\\n\\n150\\n\\nSummons tokens\\nSummons \\ntracker\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMove       4\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n: -\\n: 1\\n: 2: 6\\nSummon Rat Swarm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOISON\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n821Gnawing Horde\\n\\n\\n150\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n 3\\n\\n\\n2', ' 27\\n\\nRECOVER AND REFRESH\\n\\n\\nCertain abilities allow a player to \\n\\n recover\\n\\n discarded or lost \\n\\nability\\n\\n cards. This means that the player can look \\nthrough his or her discard or lost pile (or discarded or lost cards in his or her active area), select up to a number \\nof cards specified in the ability, and immediately return them to his or her hand. Some cards, however, \\n\\n cannot \\n\\n\\nbe recovered or refreshed once lost\\n . This is denoted by the\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002symbol. This symbol applies to the card no \\nmatter how the card was lost or consumed.\\n\\n\\nRef\\n\\nresh\\n\\n abilities allow players to regain the use of spent or consumed \\n\\n item\\n\\n cards. \\n\\n\\nIn th\\n\\ne case of both recover and refresh, the type of card gained (discarded or lost for ability cards, spent or \\nconsumed for item cards) is specified in the ability.\\n\\n\\nLOOT\\n\\n\\nA “Loot X” ability allows a character to pick up every money token and treasure tile within \\nrange X. This action is unaffected by the positions of monsters or obstacles, but note this \\nis considered a ranged ability for the purposes of line-of-sight. Money tokens are kept in a \\nplayer’s personal supply and are not shared with the other players. If a treasure tile is looted, \\nimmediately refer to the reference number in the treasure index in the back of the scenario \\nbook to determine what is found (see Treasure on p. 15 for details). If a character loots an \\nitem he or she already owns a copy of, the new item is immediately sold to the city’s available \\nsupply (see Buying and Selling Items on p. 43 for details).\\nSome actions also have an experience value attached to them, \\n\\ndenoted by\\u2003\\u2003. When that action is taken, the character gains \\n\\nthe number of experience specified. An ability card cannot be \\nplayed for the experience alone—a character must use one \\nor more of the accompanying abilities to earn the experience. \\nIn addition, sometimes the action specifies that experience is \\nonly earned under certain conditions, such as consuming an \\nelemental infusion or if the attacked target is adjacent to an \\nattacker’s allies\\u2003\\u2002. Some persistent bonuses will also give \\na character experience, denoted by\\u2003\\u2003, when that charge \\nof the bonus is expended\\u2003\\u2002 (i.e., when the character token \\nmoves off that slot). \\n Characters do not automatically gain \\nexperience from killing monsters. Only using specific actions \\n\\nawards experience.\\nEND-OF-TURN LOOTING\\n\\n\\nIn addition to specific loot abilities, \\n a character must also loot any money tokens or treasure tiles present in \\nthe hex he or she occupies at the end of the character’s turn\\n .

However, if an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage, \\nor disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn. If an effect is added to an attack, it \\nfunctions exactly as if it had been written on the action card being used for the attack. There is no limit to the \\nnumber of items a character can use on their turn or even during a specific ability. Any instance of applying \\nthe effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use.

It finds the shortest possible path to get in range and line-of-sight to use its \\nattack, and the figure that can be attacked at the end of that path is the focus. This enemy figure is \\nconsidered the “closest.” It doesn’t matter if the monster can’t get within range to attack with its \\ncurrent movement, as long as there is a path to eventually get within range. If a monster does not have \\nan attack listed on its ability card for the round, it finds a focus as if it had a melee attack. In the case \\nwhere the monster can move the same number of spaces to get within range (and line-of-sight) of \\nmultiple enemy figures (e.g., because it starts its turn within range of multiple enemies), proximity from \\nthe monster’s current position (i.e. number of hexes they are away, not counting through walls) is then \\nchecked as a tie-breaker for determining “closest.”\\n  \\nIn addition to determining order of action, the number \\non the monster standee\\u2003\\u2002corresponds to a section of \\nthe monster stat sleeve\\u2003\\u2002that can be used to track \\n\\ndamage and condition tokens.\\n\\nMonster Turn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n\\n3\\n3\\n1\\n\\n1\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n4\\n1\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 1\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n62\\n\\n41\\n\\n2-\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\nTarget     2Target     25\\n\\n63\\n\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\n2-\\n\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\nShield      1\\n\\n\\nTarget     3Target     2\\n5\\n\\n\\n73\\n\\n42\\n\\n3-\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\nShield      1\\n\\n\\nTarget     3Target     2\\n7\\n\\n\\n103\\n\\n42\\n\\n3-\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n\\nShield      1\\n\\n\\n\\nTarget     3Target     2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShield     1\\nShield     1\\nShield     1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLiving Bones\\n\\n\\n Living Bones\\n\\n\\nLiving Bones\\n\\n\\n\\nLiving Bones\\n\\n0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nba\\na\\nb', '30\\n\\n• \\nIf more than one enemy ties for being the closest, the second priority is to focus on the enemy who \\n\\n\\nis \\n\\nearlier in the initiative order \\n(summons are focused on before the character who summoned them \\nin this regard, even on the round they are summoned, and a character who is performing a long rest \\nwould be focused on last).\\n  \\n\\n\\nMONSTER MOVEMENT\\n\\n \\n\\nA monster can move on its turn if \\n\\n “Move±X” \\n\\nis part of its ability card. It can move up to a number of hexes \\nequal to its base move value (found on its monster statistic card) modified by X (either positive or negative).\\nIf a monster has a move but no attack afterward as part of its ability card, it will use its movement to get \\nas close as possible to its focused target (determined as if it had a melee attack), moving along the shortest \\npossible path to enter a hex adjacent to its focused enemy.\\nIf a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such \\na way as to attack its focused enemy with \\n\\n maximum effect\\n\\n. If it is a \\n\\nsingle-target melee \\n\\nattack, it will simply \\nmove toward the nearest hex adjacent to its focus to attack. If it is a \\n multi-target attack\\n, it will move toward a \\nposition where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible.\\n\\nIf the monster is performing a \\n ranged\\n attack, it will only move toward a hex where it is within range to perform \\nits best possible attack. A monster will also move away from its focused enemy until it can perform the ranged \\nattack without Disadvantage. When forced to choose, a monster will prioritize losing Disadvantage on its \\nfocused enemy over maximizing its attack on secondary targets. Even if a monster cannot move into attack \\nrange, it will still use its movement to get as close as possible to its focus.\\nHaving abilities other than “Attack” on its ability card does not affect a monster’s movement in any way. It will \\nsimply move according to the above rules and then use its other abilities as best as it can.\\n\\nExample:\\n \\nMonster\\u2003\\u2002can perform a “Move 3” ability. It first \\nfocuses on the Brute\\u2003\\u2002, since he is the closest enemy. If the \\nmonster had a ranged attack, it would remain in its current hex \\nand attack the Brute. If it had a single-target melee attack, it would \\nmove 1 hex\\u2003\\u2002to be adjacent to the Brute and attack. If it could \\nattack two targets with a melee attack, it would move \\n2 hexes\\u2003\\u2002to be adjacent to both the Brute and the Tinkerer. If it \\ncould melee attack three or more targets, it would move \\n3 hexes\\u2003\\u2002to be adjacent to all three characters.\\n\\n\\nExample:\\n \\nEven though the Brute\\u2003\\u2002is physically \\ncloser to Monster\\u2003\\u2002, the monster is performing a \\nmelee attack and can get in range of the Tinkerer in \\nfewer steps (2 instead of 4), so the monster focuses \\non the Tinkerer\\u2003\\u2002.\\n\\nIn the case where there are no valid targets on \\nwhich to focus, because there are no valid hexes a \\nmonster can attack from (i.e., they are all blocked, \\noccupied, or there is no open path to reach them), \\nregardless of the number of hexes it could move, a \\nmonster will not move or attack on its turn, but it \\nwill perform any of the other actions on its ability \\ncard that it is able.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\nc\\nc\\nb\\nb\\n\\nd\\nd\\n\\n 1\\n1\\n\\n\\naa\\nb\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n1\\n\\n\\nb\\n\\na\\n211\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n\\n', ' 31\\n\\nMONSTER INTERACTION WITH TRAPS AND HAZARDOUS TERRAIN\\n\\n\\nMonsters without the Flying trait consider negative hexes (traps or hazardous terrain) to be obstacles when \\ndetermining focus and movement \\n\\n unless\\n\\n movement through one of these hexes is the \\n\\n only\\n\\n way they can focus \\n\\non a target. In this case, they will use the path moving through the smallest number of negative hexes possible \\nto find a focus and suffer any consequences.\\n\\nExample:\\n \\nEven though the Tinkerer\\u2003\\u2002 is closer, \\nMonster\\u2003\\u2002will focus on the Brute\\u2003\\u2002with its \\nmelee attack because it considers traps to be \\nobstacles. Only if the Brute were not there and the \\nonly enemy the monster could focus on was the \\nTinkerer would it do so and cross the traps to get \\n\\n\\nto him.\\n\\n\\nMONSTER ATTACKS\\n\\n\\nA monster will attack on its turn if \\n\\n “Attack±X” \\n\\nis part of its ability card. Any damage dealt is calculated from its \\nbase attack value (found on its monster statistic card) modified by X (either positive or negative). Monsters will \\nalways attack their focused enemies (see Monster Focus on pp. 29–30 for details) but if the monster can attack \\nmultiple targets, it will attack its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible to \\n\\n maximum effect\\n\\n. If a \\n\\n\\nmonster has multiple attacks, it will choose the focus of its other attacks following normal focus rules, excluding \\nfigures it is already attacking. Any attack that does not specify a range on the monster ability card should use \\nthe base range of the monster written on its stat card.\\nMonster attacks function exactly like character attacks, and are modified by the attacker’s attack bonuses, then \\nattack modifier cards, then the defense bonuses of their target. They may be performed with Advantage or \\nDisadvantage as discussed on pp. 20–21.\\n\\n\\nOTHER MONSTER ABILITIES\\n\\n\\nHea\\nling:\\n\\n Monster healing functions exactly like character healing as discussed on p. 26. With a “Heal X” ability, \\nthe monster will heal themselves or an ally within the specified range, whichever has lost the most hit points.\\n\\n\\nSummons: \\n\\nMonster summon abilities place new monsters on the board that behave exactly like the normal \\nmonsters, acting according to played monster ability cards of their type. Summoned monsters are placed in an \\nempty hex adjacent to the summoning monster and also as close to an enemy as possible. If there are no empty \\nadjacent hexes or there are no available standees of the summoned monster type, the summon fails. Summoned \\nmonsters never act on the round they are summoned, nor do they drop money tokens when killed.\\n Example:\\n Archer\\u2003\\u2002will focus on the Brute\\u2003\\u2002, since she \\ncan get in range to attack him with the least number of \\nmoves. If the archer has a Range 3 attack and Move 2, \\nshe will move to hex\\u2003\\u2002and attack her focus. If she only \\nhas Move 1, however, she will stay where she is and not \\nattack. She will not move into the trap\\u2003\\u2002, even though \\nit would put her in range to attack the Brute, because \\nthere is still another viable path to get within range of \\nthe Brute, even if she can’t use it this turn. She also will \\nnot move to hex\\u2003\\u2002, as it would get her no closer to \\n\\nbeing in range of the Brute.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 1\\n\\n1\\n 1\\n\\n1\\n\\nb\\naa\\na\\nab\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nb\\nb\\nc c\\n\\nd d\\n', '32\\n\\nBonus abilities: \\nAbility card bonuses are activated through actions \\n only when the monster activates \\n\\nand\\n\\n \\n\\nare \\n\\n\\nonly active until the end of the round in which the card was drawn.\\n\\nLooting: \\nMonsters do \\n\\nnot\\n\\n perform end-of-turn looting, but some monsters do have loot actions. In these cases, \\na monster will pick up all money tokens within the specified range. These money tokens are lost and are not \\ndropped again when the looting monster is killed. Monsters are unable to loot treasure tiles.\\n\\n\\nAMBIGUITY\\n\\n\\nIf the rules ever make any monster action ambiguous because there are multiple viable hexes to which the \\nmonster could move, multiple equally viable targets to heal or attack, or multiple hexes a monster could push \\nor pull a character into, the players must decide which option the monster will take.\\n\\n\\nBOSSES\\n\\n\\nEnd of Round\\n\\n\\nOnce all figures have taken a turn, the round ends and some cleanup steps may be necessary:\\n\\n• \\nIf a standard \\n“2x”\\u2003\\u2002 \\u2002\\n\\nor \\n\\n“Null”\\u2003\\u2002\\u2002 \\nattack modifier card was drawn from a specific modifier deck \\nduring the round, shuffle all the discards of that deck back into its draw deck.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nIf a m\\nonster ability card with a shuffle symbol\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002was drawn at the start of the round, shuffle all \\ndiscards for the corresponding monster type back into its deck.\\n  \\n\\n• \\n\\nIf \\nthere are any elemental infusion tokens in the \\n Strong \\n\\ncolumn\\n\\n,\\n move them to the Waning column.

Explanations for more \\ncomplicated abilities can be found in the Scenario Book. \\nBosses’ stats are often based on the number of characters, \\nwhich is signified by the letter “C” on the boss stat card. \\n\\nLastly, \\n\\nbosses are immune to certain negative conditions. \\nThe conditions to which they are immune are listed on \\ntheir stat card\\u2003\\u2002.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8xC33-10x\\nC33-\\n12\\nx\\nC43-\\n13\\nxC44-Summon Living BonesMove to next door and reveal room\\n1:\\n2:Summon Living BonesMove to next door and reveal room\\n1:\\n2:Summon Living BonesMove to next door and reveal room1:\\n2:\\nSummon Living BonesMove to next door and reveal room1:\\n2:\\nBandit Commander Bandit CommanderBandit Commander\\nBandit Commander01\\n2\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoss\\n\\n\\n\\na\\nb\\na\\nb', \" 33\\n\\nROUND TRACKER\\n\\n\\nSome scenarios may require players to keep track of what \\n\\nround it is. A round track can be found at the top of the \\nelemental infusion table for this purpose. At the end of \\nevery round, simply move the tracker token\\u2003\\u2002 forward \\n\\n\\none space. \\n\\nNote\\n\\n that it is not necessary to keep track of \\n\\nthe rounds for most scenarios.\\n\\n\\nFinishing a Scenario\\n\\n\\nA scenario can end in one of two ways: success or failure. Once \\na scenario’s success or failure conditions are triggered, \\n\\n the \\n\\n\\nremainder of the round is played out, \\n and then the scenario ends.\\n\\nSuccess or failure\\n, players tally the experience their individual \\ncharacters earned during the scenario and tally the money tokens \\ntheir characters looted during the scenario and convert them \\ninto gold. Each money token looted is worth an amount of gold \\nbased on the scenario level and specified on the chart on p. 15. \\nAnything not looted during the scenario is \\n\\n not\\n\\n collected. Players \\nalso recover all lost and discarded ability cards, refresh all spent \\nand exhausted item cards, and return their hit point dials to their \\nmaximum hit point value so that they can start fresh in a future scenario. Players should also go through their \\nattack modifier deck and remove any BLESS cards, CURSE cards, and any other negative cards added through \\nscenario and item effects. This should also be done with the monster attack modifier deck. All battle goals are \\nshuffled back into the battle goal deck, regardless of whether they were completed.\\n\\nIf players successfully complete the scenario\\n , they receive checkmarks for their characters’ completed battle \\ngoal cards at this time. Checkmarks are recorded on the player’s character sheet and completing a set of three \\nimmediately earns a character an additional perk (see Additional Perks on p. 44 for details). Even if a character \\nis exhausted, as long as the scenario was successfully completed, that character can still complete his or her \\nbattle goal, earn scenario rewards, and keep all the money and experience he or she collected before becoming \\nexhausted. There is no penalty for becoming exhausted. Players also receive bonus experience for successfully \\ncompleting the scenario. This bonus is equal to \\n four plus twice the scenario level \\n (see Scenario Level on p. 15 \\n\\n\\nfor details).\\n\\nIf players are playing in a campaign, successfully completing a scenario \\nwill also allow them to read the conclusion flavor text of the scenario \\nand gain the benefits listed at the end (see Scenario Completion on \\np. 49 for details). In a campaign the money and experience collected \\nduring a scenario will be very important to improve a character’s skills \\nand abilities and should be tracked on the player’s character sheet\\u2003\\u2002. \\nIf the scenario was not part of a campaign, money and experience can \\nbe used as metric for gauging how well each character did.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\nRemove two           cards\\n\\n\\nReplace one           card \\nwith one           card\\n\\nAdd two          cards\\n\\nAdd one           card\\n\\nAdd three     PUSH    1 \\ncards\\n\\n\\nAdd two     PIERCE    3 cards\\n\\nAdd one     STUN    card\\n\\nAdd one     DISARM    card\\nand one     MUDDLE    card\\n\\nAdd one     ADD \\nTARGET    card\\n\\n\\n\\nIgnore negative item eﬀ ects \\nand add one           card\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd one        Shield      1, Self card\\n\\nInox Brute\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\nRemove two           cards\\n\\n\\nReplace one           card \\nwith one           card\\n\\nAdd two          cards\\n\\nAdd one           card\\n\\nAdd three     PUSH    1 \\ncards\\n\\n\\nAdd two     PIERCE    3 cards\\n\\nAdd one     STUN    card\\n\\nAdd one     DISARM    card\\nand one     MUDDLE    card\\n\\nAdd one     ADD \\nTARGET    card\\n\\n\\n\\nIgnore negative item eﬀ ects \\nand add one           card\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd one        Shield      1, Self card\\n\\nInox Brute\\n\\nCharacter Sheet\\n\\n\\nHave ﬁ ve or more \\ntotal cards in your \\nhand and discard \\nat the end of the \\nscenario.

This allows players to follow a story thread as they make decisions and explore a path \\nof their own choosing. A scenario can only be played in campaign mode if all the prerequisite global and party \\nachievements listed as required in the Scenario Book are active for the party. In addition, once a scenario has been \\ncompleted in campaign mode, it cannot be undertaken again in campaign mode by \\n any party\\n.\\n\\nIn \\n\\ncasual mode\\n, players can play any revealed scenario on the world map regardless of achievements or \\n whether it has \\n\\nbeen completed in campaign mode. Players can still gain experience and money, loot treasure tiles, complete battle \\ngoals, and make progress toward completing their personal quests, but any story text or rewards listed at the end of \\nthe scenario are disregarded. A party in campaign mode can switch to casual mode to go through a scenario they have \\nalready completed, but it is \\n\\n strongly recommended\\n\\n that a party not undertake a scenario in casual mode that they \\nhaven’t yet experienced in campaign mode.\\n\\nThe rules that follow will deal specifically with playing the game in campaign mode.\\n\\n Special Scenario Rules\\n\\n\\nMany scenarios will feature extra rules. The following are clarifications for common special scenario rules:\\n\\n• \\n\\nSpawning:\\n\\n When a monster is spawned, it is set up on the map at its spawning location or the nearest \\nempty hex to that location. If a monster is spawned at the end of a round, it will begin to activate on the \\nfollowing round. If a monster is spawned during a round, it activates as if it had just been revealed (see     \\nRevealing a Room on p. 19 for details).\\n  \\n\\n• \\nLocked doors:\\n Some doors are classified as “locked,” which means they cannot be opened by a character \\nmoving onto them. Instead, they act as walls until the conditions to open them specified in the scenario \\n\\nbook are met. \\n\\n• \\nPressure plates:\\n Pressure plates function similarly to corridors, in that they have no effect on a figure’s \\nmovement. Instead, if a pressure plate is occupied by a character at the end of a turn, it may trigger a \\nspecial effect specified in the scenario book, such as opening a door or spawning a monster.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nDestroying obstacles:\\n When an obstacle is specified as having hit points in the scenario book, it can be \\nattacked and will be destroyed and removed from the board when it drops below 1 hit point. Obstacles \\nwith hit points can only be destroyed through damage and not through other character abilities. These \\nobstacles are considered enemies for all ability purposes and have an initiative of 99 for the purpose of \\nsummon focusing, but they are immune to all negative conditions.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nObjective and scenario aid tokens:\\n  Objective tokens\\u2003\\u2002are used in many scenarios \\n\\n\\nto \\n\\nrepresent allied figures or loot locations. In the case of allied figures, the numbers \\non the tokens should be randomized when placed, with the numbers determining \\nthe figures’ activation order. Scenario aid tokens\\u2003\\u2002can be placed on the map tiles to act as a reminder for \\nspecial cases, such as where enemies spawn or when to read numbered sections from the scenario book.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nNamed monsters:\\n Often times the goal of a scenario is to kill a specific monster, \\n either a boss or a unique \\n\\nvariant of a regular monster, as specified in the scenario rules. These monsters are not considered normal \\nor elite and thus are not affected by character abilities that target only normal or elite monsters.\\n  \\n\\n• \\n\\nEquations:\\n\\n Some scenario properties such as hit points for obstacles or named monsters are determined by \\nequations that depend on the scenario level and the number of characters. In such instances, “L” is used to \\ndenote the scenario level, and “C” is used to denote the number of characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 1\\na\\nb ba', ' 35\\n\\nThe \\n\\ncampaign board\\n\\n is used to track the global progress of the game world. The locations, achievements, and \\nprosperity tracked on the board apply globally to all parties playing in the world.\\n\\n\\nTHE BOARD INCLUDES:\\n\\n\\n• \\nA map of Gloomhaven\\u2003\\u2002and the surrounding area\\u2003\\u2002. Numbered circles on the map\\u2003\\u2002represent \\nscenarios that can be unlocked through the course of playing the campaign. When a scenario is \\nunlocked, its corresponding sticker\\u2003\\u2002is placed over the numbered circle (see Scenario Completion \\non p. 49 for details). When an unlocked scenario is completed in campaign mode, the blank spot on its \\nsticker\\u2003\\u2002is marked to signify this.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nA reference grid for the map\\u2003\\u2002so that scenario locations can more easily be found.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nA space for tracking global achievements\\u2003\\u2002. When a global achievement is unlocked, its corresponding \\nsticker\\u2003\\u2002should be placed in one of the sticker slots in this space (see Achievements on p. 40 for \\n\\ndetails).\\n\\n \\n\\n• \\nA prosperity track\\u2003\\u2002. When the prosperity of Gloomhaven increases, a square on the prosperity track \\nshould be marked for every point of increase, moving from left to right (see Gloomhaven Prosperity on \\np. 48 for details). At certain thresholds, this will increase the prosperity level of Gloomhaven.\\n\\n Campaign Board\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\nb\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni\\n e\\nh\\n\\nf\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\nd\\n d\\n\\ng\\n\\nLocation sticker\\n\\ne\\nf\\nh g\\nia b c\\n\\nd', '36\\nParty Sheet\\n\\n\\nA \\n\\nparty\\n\\n is formed when a new group of players gets together to play the game.

At \\ncertain times, the game will direct players to open one of these. If it contains materials for a new character \\nclass, that character class is now available for anyone starting a new character. If the envelope contains other \\ncontents, the contents will direct the players how to use them.\\nPlayers will be directed to open boxes or envelopes when they complete personal quests or meet specific \\nconditions. These conditions are listed on p. 49.\\n\\n\\nTown Records\\n\\nAchievements\\n\\n\\nThe achievement system is the main way that players will keep track of major changes in the world and \\nwhat scenarios a particular party has access to while playing in campaign mode. There are two types of \\n\\n\\nachievements: \\n\\nglobal achievements \\n\\nand \\n\\nparty achievements\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\nGlobal achievements \\n\\naffect the entire game world, regardless of what party is playing in it. Global \\nachievements are tracked with stickers along the top of the world map\\u2003\\u2002. Some global achievements have a \\nspecific type (listed after the achievement in the format of “Type: Achievement,” e.g., “City Rule: Militaristic”). \\nOnly one global achievement of each type can be active at a time. If a global achievement is gained and there is \\nalready an active achievement of the same type, the previous achievement is overwritten and the new sticker is \\nplaced on top of the previous one. Multiple instances of a single global achievement are possible, so long they \\ndon’t have a specific type.\\n\\n\\nParty achievements \\n\\nare tied to a specific party and are mainly used \\n\\nto keep track of what scenarios are available to play in campaign \\n\\nmode for that party.The game box also includes a small sealed book titled “Town Records.” Players are \\ndirected to open this book once the first character retires, at which point they can \\nbegin reading the book from front to back. At certain points in the book, players will \\nbe directed to stop reading until certain conditions are met.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\na', ' 41\\nPlaying a Campaign\\nTraveling and Road Events\\n\\n\\nIf players return to Gloomhaven, once they are finished with their \\n\\n business\\n\\n in town (see Visiting Gloomhaven \\non pp. 42–48 for details), then the party will still need to \\n\\n travel\\n\\n to a new scenario and complete a road event \\n\\nunless the new scenario is linked to Gloomhaven or it is being played in casual mode\\n . This link will also be \\n\\nlisted in the scenario’s entry in the scenario book.\\n\\nExample:\\n \\nAfter completing the\\n  \\nBlack Barrow\\n \\nscenario, the party unlocks the\\n  \\nBarrow Lair\\n \\nscenario. These two \\n\\n\\nscenarios are\\n\\n \\n\\nlinked\\n\\n, so they could travel to the Barrow Lair without completing a road event. Instead, they \\n\\ndecide to go back to\\n  \\nGloomhaven\\n \\nto spend the money they gathered. Now when they travel to the Barrow \\nLair, they must complete a road event because the Barrow Lair is not linked to Gloomhaven.\\n\\n\\nCOMPLETING ROAD EVENTS\\n\\n\\nTo complete a road event, players draw a single card from the road event deck and read the introductory text \\non the front. After this text, two options are given, and players must agree on a single choice \\n\\n before\\n\\n turning \\n\\n\\nover the card and reading the matching outcome. \\n Once the outcome has been read, the choice cannot be \\n\\n\\nchanged\\n\\n, and players must gain or lose whatever the outcome directs.\\nDepending on the makeup and reputation of the party, a single \\n\\n choice\\n\\n (A or B) can have several different \\n\\n\\noutcomes\\n\\n. A choice should be read top to bottom, resolving all outcomes that apply to the party. After every scenario, whether it was a success or failure, players have the choice to either return to \\nGloomhaven or to immediately \\n\\n travel\\n\\n to a new scenario.\\n\\nIn the case that players immediately travel to a new scenario, they must complete a road event before starting \\n\\nthe new scenario \\nunless they are playing the same scenario, the new scenario is linked to the previous \\nscenario, or they are playing in casual mode\\n . In a scenario’s entry in the Scenario Book, the scenarios that are \\n\\n\\nlinked\\n\\n to that entry are listed on the upper right side of the page\\u2003\\u2002. If the two scenarios are \\n\\n linked\\n\\n, players \\ncan immediately start the new scenario without completing a road event.\\nAn outcome can be preceded by one of the following conditions:\\n\\n• \\nA class icon. As long as one of the listed class icons matches the class \\nicon of a current member of the party, the outcome is applied.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nA range of reputation. If the party’s reputation is within the designated \\nrange, the outcome is applied.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nA collective gold amount. If the party collectively has equal to or more \\nthan the gold amount, that amount is lost, and the outcome is applied.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nThe word “otherwise.” If none of the preceding outcomes were applied, \\napply this outcome instead.\\n  \\n\\nIf the outcome does not have a condition, the outcome is applied.\\n\\n\\n       : You quickly identify the source of the problem — some frayed wiring in the \\nkitchen — and have it replaced in no time.

If a player is directed to lose anything (money, \\ncheckmarks, etc.), but they cannot do so because they do not have a sufficient amount of that thing to lose, \\nthey lose what they are able to lose and continue resolving the event. A character can never lose a checkmark \\nthat would cause him or her to lose a perk, have negative money, or be brought below the minimum \\nexperience required for his or her current level, and the town can never be brought below the minimum \\n\\n\\nprosperity for its current level.\\n\\n\\nVisiting Gloomhaven\\n\\n\\nWhenever a party returns to Gloomhaven, they can perform a variety of activities: \\n creating new characters\\n, \\n\\n\\ncompleting\\n\\n \\ncity events\\n, \\nbuying and selling items\\n, \\n\\nleveling up their character\\n\\n,\\n donating to the sanctuary\\n,\\n \\n\\n\\nenhancing ability cards\\n\\n,\\n \\n\\nand \\n\\nannouncing retirement\\n\\n. A new visit to Gloomhaven can be triggered after every \\nscenario played in campaign mode.\\n\\n\\nCREATING NEW CHARACTERS\\n\\n\\nThe first step in any character’s story is creation. Players will create new characters when they first start playing \\nthe game, when they retire an old character and wish to continue playing, or pretty much whenever they want \\nto try something new. When the box is first opened, the following six classes are available to play: Brute \\u2003 , \\nTinkerer \\u2003 , Spellweaver \\u2003 , Scoundrel \\u2003 , Cragheart \\u2003 , and Mindthief \\u2003 .\\nWhen a player creates a new character, he or she gains access to that character’s character mat and deck of \\nLevel 1 and “X” ability cards. The player should create a new entry in the class’s corresponding character sheet \\nnotepad, and also draw two random personal quest cards, choosing to keep one and shuffling the other back \\ninto the deck. \\n\\nA player can start a character at any level equal to or lower than the prosperity level of the city (see \\n\\nGloomhaven Prosperity on p. 48 for details). If a player starts a character above Level 1, they should go through \\nall the steps outlined on p. 44 for each level increase in sequence, up to and including their chosen starting \\nlevel. In addition, a newly created character receives an amount of gold equal to 15x(L+1), where L is their \\nstarting level. A character starts with an amount of experience equal to the minimum required for their level \\n(the number listed below that level on the character sheet).\\n\\n REPUTATION\\n\\n\\nReputation is tied to a specific party and is tracked on the party sheet. Any time a new party is formed, that \\n\\nparty starts at \\n\\n0 reputation\\n\\n. Through event consequences or by completing certain scenarios, the party will \\ngain or lose reputation. A party can have a maximum reputation of 20 and a minimum reputation of -20.\\nA party’s reputation has a number of implications:\\n\\n• \\nMany events have consequences that are only applied if the party meets specific reputation \\n\\n\\nrequirements.\\n \\n\\n• \\nWhen buying items, players modify the cost based on their reputation. They receive a reduction in \\ncost at a higher reputation and an increase in cost at a lower reputation. These cost modifications are \\nwritten next to the reputation track on the party sheet.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nCertain sealed envelopes are opened when a party reaches specific positive and negative values of \\n\\nreputation.', ' 43\\n\\nCOMPLETING CITY EVENTS\\n\\n\\nOnce per visit to Gloomhaven, a party may complete a city event. City events are functionally the same as road \\nevents, but are drawn from the city event deck and generally have better outcomes than road events.\\nWhen in Gloomhaven, characters have the opportunity to \\nbuy item cards by spending the gold they’ve collected from \\nscenarios. In addition, players can also sell back any item \\n\\n\\nfor \\n\\nhalf\\n\\n the price listed on the item card (rounded down). \\nWhen an item is sold, it goes back into the city’s available \\nsupply, and the character receives the calculated amount of \\ngold. Players can own as many items as they can afford, but \\nare limited in how many they can equip (see Item Cards on \\np. 8 for details). \\nPlayers cannot trade money or items.\\n\\nWhen the game box is opened and the campaign begins, the city’s available supply should consist of all copies \\nof Item 001 through Item 014. Over the course of the campaign, many more items will be added to the city’s \\navailable supply based on the following conditions:\\n\\n• \\nAny time an item \\n\\n design\\n\\n is gained from a scenario or event, every copy \\nof that item card is added to the city’s available supply.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nAs the city gains prosperity levels (see Gloomhaven Prosperity on p. 48 \\nfor details), new items will be made available in the supply. The list of \\nwhat items are made available at each prosperity level can be found to \\n\\n\\nthe right.\\n \\n\\n• \\nLastly, when a character retires, all of their item cards go back into the \\n\\nshop’s supply.\\n\\n \\n\\nWithin any one party, the number of items available for purchase is limited by how many copies of the item’s \\ncard there are. No character may own duplicates of the same item. If a different party plays the game with \\ndifferent characters, items possessed by \\n unused characters\\n are considered to be in the city’s available supply \\nand can be purchased. Players should always keep track of what items they own on their character sheets in \\ncase the cards get moved around by other groups.\\n\\nBUYING AND SELLING ITEMS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2/4\\n\\n\\n\\nMinor Healing Potion\\n10\\n\\n\\nDuring your turn, perform \\na “Heal      3, Self” action.\\n\\n\\n771\\n\\n\\n\\n012\\n\\n 1001–014\\n2015–021\\n3022–028\\n4029–035\\n5036–042\\n6043–049\\n7050–056\\n8057–063\\n9064–070\\n\\n\\nProsp.\\nItem Cards', '44\\n\\n \\n\\nExample: \\nThe Brute marks the “Replace one\\u2003\\u2002card with \\none\\u2003\\u2002card,” so he removes a\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002card from his attack \\nmodifier deck and adds a\\u2003\\u2003\\u2002card (taken from his Brute \\nmodifier deck) in its place.\\n\\n\\nADDITIONAL PERKS\\n\\nLastly, leveling up also increases a character’s hit point total\\u2003\\u2002, as indicated on their character mat.\\n\\n\\nLeveling up \\n\\nnever\\n\\n changes a character’s maximum hand size. This is fixed for each class.\\nAny time a character successfully completes a battle goal card \\nat the end of a scenario, they receive a number of checkmarks, \\nwhich are tracked in the specified area of the notes section of \\n\\ntheir character sheet. For every three checkmarks a character \\n\\nearns, he or she immediately gains an additional perk on their \\ncharacter sheet and applies its effects to their attack modifier \\ndeck. Any checkmarks from a battle goal that are left over after \\nachieving a perk are applied toward the next perk. A character \\ncan achieve a total of six additional perks in this way.\\n\\n LEVELING UP\\n\\n\\nWhen a character gains the amount of experience listed on the table to the \\nright, they must level up. \\n Leveling up only occurs in town\\n .\\n\\nWhen a character reaches a new level, add \\n\\n one\\n\\n new card to their active card \\npool. The card selected must be from the character’s class and have a card \\n\\n\\nlevel \\n\\nequal to or less than the character’s new level\\n .\\n\\nAdditionally, when leveling up, the player can mark \\n\\n one\\n\\n of the \\n\\nperk\\n\\n boxes \\n\\n\\non the right side of their character sheet. This signifies an evolution of the \\ncharacter’s attack modifier deck.  Apply the bonuses of the marked perk box to \\nthe character’s modifier deck using the class’s accompanying deck of available \\nmodifier cards. If a perk has multiple check boxes next to it, this means that the \\nperk can be gained multiple times for the cost of one perk each.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nGain 7 or fewer \\nexperience \\npoints during the \\nscenario.Layabout\\n\\n\\n459\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\nRemove two           cards\\n\\n\\nReplace one           card \\nwith one           card\\n\\nAdd two          cards\\n\\nAdd one           card\\n\\nAdd three     PUSH    1 \\ncards\\n\\n\\nAdd two     PIERCE    3 cards\\n\\nAdd one     STUN    card\\n\\nAdd one     DISARM    card\\nand one     MUDDLE    card\\n\\nAdd one     ADD \\nTARGET    card\\n\\n\\n\\nIgnore negative item eﬀ ects \\nand add one           card\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd one        Shield      1, Self card\\n\\nInox Brute\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n001\\n\\n\\n\\n 001\\n\\nBrute Deck Icon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\n\\n:\\n\\n\\nRemove two           cards\\n\\n\\nReplace one           card \\nwith one           card\\n\\nAdd two          cards\\n\\nAdd one           card\\n\\nAdd three     PUSH    1 \\ncards\\n\\n\\nAdd two     PIERCE    3 cards\\n\\nAdd one     STUN    card\\n\\nAdd one     DISARM    card\\nand one     MUDDLE    card\\n\\nAdd one     ADD \\nTARGET    card\\n\\n\\n\\nIgnore negative item eﬀ ects \\nand add one           card\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd one        Shield      1, Self card\\n\\nInox Brute\\n 10\\n245\\n395\\n4150\\n5210\\n6275\\n7345\\n8420\\n9500\\n\\n Level\\nExperience\\n\\n End of round:\\nMonster actions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn turn:Initiative [ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBB\\nBor\\n\\n\\n\\nAA\\nAChoose one pathStart of Round:\\nǱǱReduceǱelementǱstrength.ǱǱOptionalǱshortǱrest:ǱloseǱoneǱrandomǱdiscardǱandǱrecoverǱtheǱrest.ǱǱShuffleǱǱǱǱǱǱattackǱandǱmonsterǱdecksǱwhereǱapplicable.EliteǱfirst,ǱthenǱnormalǱinǱascendingǱnumericalǱorder.ǱFocusǱonǱǱǱǱǱǱclosest,ǱǱǱǱǱǱlowestǱinitiative.Ǳ ThenǱmoveǱtoǱmaximizeǱattackǱonǱfocus.LoseǱoneǱdiscardǱandǱrecoverǱtheǱrest,ǱHealǱǱǱǱǱ(self)ǱandrefreshǱǱǱǱǱǱspentǱitems.\\n\\n2\\n99\\nPerformǱtopǱabilityǱofǱoneǱcardǱandǱbottomǱabilityǱofǱtheǱotherǱinǱanyǱorder.LeadingǱcardǱplayedRevealǱmonsterǱactions,ǱactǱinǱinitiativeǱ[ǱǱǱ]Ǳorder.\\nLongǱrestPlayǱ2Ǳcards \\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n 10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n12\\n\\n14\\n\\n16\\n18\\n\\n20\\n\\n22\\n\\n24\\n\\n26\\n\\nActive\\n\\n\\nConditions\\n\\nDiscard\\n\\n Lost\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of round:\\nMonster actions:\\n\\n\\n\\nOn turn:Initiative [ ]:\\n\\n\\n\\nBB\\nBor\\n\\nAA\\nAChoose one pathStart of Round:\\nǱǱReduceǱelementǱstrength.ǱǱOptionalǱshortǱrest:ǱloseǱoneǱrandomǱdiscardǱandǱrecoverǱtheǱrest.ǱǱShuffleǱǱǱǱǱǱattackǱandǱmonsterǱdecksǱwhereǱapplicable.EliteǱfirst,ǱthenǱnormalǱinǱascendingǱnumericalǱorder.ǱFocusǱonǱǱǱǱǱǱclosest,ǱǱǱǱǱǱlowestǱinitiative.Ǳ ThenǱmoveǱtoǱmaximizeǱattackǱonǱfocus.LoseǱoneǱdiscardǱandǱrecoverǱtheǱrest,ǱHealǱǱǱǱǱ(self)ǱandrefreshǱǱǱǱǱǱspentǱitems.\\n\\n2\\n99\\nPerformǱtopǱabilityǱofǱoneǱcardǱandǱbottomǱabilityǱofǱtheǱotherǱinǱanyǱorder.LeadingǱcardǱplayedRevealǱmonsterǱactions,ǱactǱinǱinitiativeǱ[ǱǱǱ]Ǳorder.\\nLongǱrestPlayǱ2Ǳcards \\n\\n12 10\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\nActive\\n\\n\\n\\nConditions\\n\\n\\nDiscard\\n\\n\\n Lost\\n\\n\\n\\na', ' 45\\n\\nBUILDING A HAND OF CARDS\\n\\n\\nWhen playing a class for the first time, it is recommended that players use a hand comprised entirely of \\nLevel 1 cards (denoted by a\\u2003\\u2003below the title). However, each character also has immediate access to \\nthree\\u2003\\u2003cards. These are typically more complex and situational than Level 1 cards. Once a player is familiar \\nwith the basic abilities of the class, they should consider incorporating one or more\\u2003\\u2003cards into their hand, \\nremoving an equal number of Level 1 cards to observe the hand limit.\\nAs characters level up, higher level ability cards will also become available. Even \\nthough players have access to more cards, the maximum number of cards they \\ncan take into battle (hand limit) remains the same. Therefore, at the beginning of \\na scenario, players must \\n select a number of cards from the character’s available \\ncard pool equal to the character’s hand limit\\n . These cards will form the player’s \\nhand, and only cards in the player’s hand may be used during a scenario.\\n\\n\\nSCENARIO SCALING\\n\\n\\nAs characters level up, the recommended scenario level will also increase, as discussed on p. 15. This will \\nincrease monster levels, trap damage, gold gained from money tokens, and scenario completion experience.\\n\\n Character Hand Limit\\n\\n\\nDONATING TO THE SANCTUARY\\n\\n\\nOnce per visit to Gloomhaven, each player can donate 10 gold to the Sanctuary of the Great Oak, a temple and \\nhospital in the city. Doing so allows the donating player to add two BLESS \\u2003\\u2003\\u2002attack modifier cards to their \\nattack modifier deck for the next scenario.\\nOnce players have completed “The Power of Enhancement” global achievement, they can spend gold while \\nvisiting Gloomhaven to increase the power of their ability cards.

The character may perform any other town activities beforehand, \\nbut he or she cannot play any new scenarios using a character with a fulfilled personal quest. The character \\nhas accomplished his or her dreams and has no more motivation to go exploring monster-filled ruins. All the \\nmaterials for the character are returned to the box, any items the character owned are returned to the city’s \\navailable supply, and all money the character owned is gone. Additionally, the city gains 1 prosperity.\\nFulfilling personal quests will always unlock new content for the game. They will allow the player to open a \\nsealed box or envelope, which will usually unlock a new character class. Any time players are directed to open \\na box or envelope and it has already been opened because of some previous condition, a new random item \\ndesign and random side scenario are unlocked instead (see p. 38 for details). When a personal quest is fulfilled, \\nthe personal quest card is removed from the game.\\nEach time an individual player retires a character, that player also gains one extra perk to apply to all future \\ncharacters they create. This effect is cumulative, so when a player retires their second character, his or her next \\ncharacter would gain two additional perks. Though this effect is applied to players, if one player is controlling \\nmultiple characters at once in a campaign (e.g., solo play), he or she considers each character lineage they \\ncontrol a different player for this bonus.\\nWhen a specific character class \\n\\n retires\\n\\n for the first time, new city and road events are usually added to the \\nevents decks. The reference number for these is written on the back side of the class’s character mat in the \\n\\nbottom \\n\\nright (rightmost number)\\n\\n. In addition, whenever a new character class is \\n\\n unlocked\\n\\n through retirement \\nor other means, new city and road events are also added to the decks. This reference number is on the back \\nside of the unlocked class’s character mat in the bottom \\n right (leftmost number)\\n . Each reference number \\n\\napplies to both the city and road event decks.\\nWhen a player’s character retires, they can choose a new character to play, drawing two new personal quest \\ncards, keeping one and discarding the other. Players are free to use the same class for their new character, but \\nfulfilling personal quests usually unlocks a new class, encouraging players to explore new play styles over the \\ncourse of the campaign. New characters may start at any level equal to or less than the current prosperity level \\n\\n\\nof the town.\\n\\n\\nIt is possible to run out of available personal quest cards. If there are no personal quest cards left when a player \\ncreates a new character, then that character does not receive a personal quest. A character without a personal \\nquest can never retire, though the player is still free to switch characters whenever he or she wishes.\\n\\n\\nGLOOMHAVEN PROSPERITY\\n\\n\\nAs the characters grow in power, the town of Gloomhaven grows in \\n prosperity\\n. Gloomhaven prosperity can \\nbe gained either through certain events or by completing certain scenarios. The prosperity points are tracked \\nalong the bottom of the map board\\u2003\\u2002, and the town will attain new levels when reaching the designated \\n\\nthresholds.\\n\\nWhen the city reaches a new level of prosperity, players gain two benefits:\\n\\n• \\nNew items become available for purchase, according to the chart on p. 43.\\n  \\n\\n• \\nNew characters may begin at any level equal to or less than the prosperity level of the town. Likewise, \\nany character with a level lower than the prosperity level may immediately advance their level to match. \\nIn either case, follow the level-up steps on p. 44, adjusting the character’s experience value to the \\nminimum value required for the new level.\\n\\n\\n\\n a a', ' 49\\nScenario Completion\\n\\nSpecial Conditions for Opening Envelopes\\n\\n\\nGain 5 “Ancient Technology” global achievements – open envelope\\n  \\nHave a par\\nty gain both “The Drake’s Command” and “The Drake’s Treasure” party achievements\\n  \\n\\n– add City Event 75 and Road Event 66 to the decks, and gain “The Drake Aided” global achievement\\n  \\n\\nDonate a total of 100 gold to the Sanctuary of the Great Oak – open envelope\\n  \\nWhen a new scenario is unlocked, find its corresponding number on the world map using its grid location and \\nplace the sticker matching the scenario on top of it\\u2003\\u2002. Note that the scenario numbers in circles within the \\nstory text do not unlock scenarios. These are simply references to what the story text is referring to. If an item \\nis gained as a reward, players should find one copy of that item from the deck of unavailable items and give it \\nto one of the present characters. If an item design is gained as a reward, players should find all copies of that \\nitem from the deck of unavailable items and add them to the city’s available supply of items. When a scenario is successfully completed as part of the \\ncampaign, a number of rewards are gained by the party. \\nThese are listed at the end of the scenario’s entry in \\nthe Scenario Book. Rewards can include global or party \\nachievements, extra gold or experience for each party \\nmember, prosperity increases, unlocked scenarios, items, \\nor item designs.

Any \\ncharacter will permanently die when they drop below one hit point (instead of being exhausted). Characters \\ncan still become exhausted as normal if they are unable to rest or play cards, except that their figure remains \\non the map and can still be targeted by monster attacks. The character cannot act at all and is considered to \\nhave an initiative of 99 for the purposes of monster focus. After a scenario is failed, any character who is still \\nalive at the end of the round survives and can continue playing.\\nWhen a character dies, all the materials for the character are returned to the box, any items the character \\nowned are returned to the city’s available supply, all money the character owned is gone, their personal quest \\nis shuffled back into the personal quest deck, and their character sheet is removed from the game. The player \\nwhose character died must then create a new character (see Creating New Characters on p. 42 for details) to \\n\\ncontinue playing. \\n\\n\\nGame Variant: Random Dungeon Deck\\n\\n\\nInstead of playing through a scenario from the Scenario Book, players always have the option to play through a \\nrandom dungeon instead. Random dungeons will not progress the campaign in any way, but they can be used \\nto gain additional experience, money, checkmarks, and personal quest progress for characters.\\nEach random dungeon consists of three randomly generated rooms and the goal is always to clear all rooms of \\nmonsters. The three rooms will be set up one at a time, with the next room only being revealed once the door \\nto it has been opened. Each room is set up using a room card and a monster card, each drawn randomly from \\nthe tops of their shuffled decks.\\n\\n• \\nA noun title\\u2003\\u2002. When combined with the adjective title on the \\nmonster card, this provides the full title of the room.\\n  \\n• \\nA graphical depiction of the map tile(s) used in the setup of the \\nroom along with twelve numerical designations of where various \\nelements of the monster card are placed during setup\\u2003\\u2002. The \\nroom setup will also depict any obstacle overlay tiles to be placed. \\nIt is possible to run out of specific overlay tiles when setting up the \\nsecond or third room. In these cases, use a comparable overlay tile \\n\\nof the same type. \\n• \\nDesignations for where players enter\\u2003\\u2002or exit\\u2003\\u2002the room and \\nwhat types the entrance(s) and exit(s) are (see below for details). \\nEntrances and exits always correspond to the nearest half-hex of \\nthe tile with a puzzle connection. If this is the first room of the \\ndungeon, players can place their figure on any empty hex within \\ntwo hexes of the entrance. If the first room has multiple entrances, \\nplayers can collectively choose on which entrance to start.\\n  \\n\\nA ROOM CARD INCLUDES:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n7\\n\\n1\\n10\\n5\\n\\n8\\n\\n2\\n11\\n6\\n\\n9\\n\\n3\\n4\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\nA\\nATile: H1b\\n\\nMajor: MUDDLE   all characters permanently.\\n\\nMinor: MUDDLE   all characters.Sewer\\n534\\n\\n\\nf\\n\\ng\\nc\\n\\ne\\n\\nd\\n\\na\\n\\nba\\nb\\nc\\nd', ' 51\\n\\n• \\nThe entrance type available for the room on the back of the card\\u2003\\u2002. There are two types of entrances and \\nexits: A and B. If players exit a room from an A exit, they must enter the next room from an A entrance and \\nvice versa with B. If the entrance of the top room in the deck does not match the exit the players used in \\nthe previous room, the top card is discarded until a matching entrance type is found.\\n  \\n \\n\\nIf a room has two exits, players may use whichever one they wish, though the one they don’t use is closed \\noff. If a room has two entrances, players must use the entrance that corresponds to the previous room’s \\n\\nexit.\\n• \\nPenalties for revealing the room\\u2003\\u2002. Whenever a new room is revealed and set up, a penalty may activate \\ndepending on the room and the difficulty decided on by the players. The suggested difficulty is to use \\nno penalties in the first room, the minor penalty of the second room when it is revealed, and the major \\npenalty of the third room when it is revealed. Players can decrease or increase the number and severity of \\nthe penalties as they like, up to a point where major penalties are activated for each of the three rooms \\nwhen they are revealed. If the character who opened the door is referenced in the penalty of the first \\nroom, players can decide who the penalty targets. If the previous room is referenced in the penalty of the \\nfirst room, nothing happens.\\n  \\n• \\nThe specific map tile(s) used to create the room\\u2003\\u2002.\\n\\n \\n\\nCredits\\n\\nA MONSTER CARD INCLUDES:\\n\\n\\n• \\nAn adjective title\\u2003\\u2002.
