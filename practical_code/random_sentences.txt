 When a
 corps LIM is added, any division LIMs
 from that corps already in the pool are
 removed.,
 Each ordered unit (except 
 
 war machines) may move two hexes and still battle.,
 Each side selects an Overall Commander who will stand behind 
 
 his three Field Generals.,
 
   For example—if the Overall Commander gives 
 
 a Leadership card that was used to order units in the Center and 
 
 Left sections, he could still give a Command card to the Right 
 
 Field Commander, but only to order units in the Right section.,
 The Counter Attack play in this case 
 
 would count as one Field Command card, because the group of 
 
 ordered units is totally in the Left section.,
 A unit that is passed through may 
 
 not be ordered this turn.,

 Suppressing Animals
 Whenever an animal card is played and that animal has 
 one of the six suppression icons underneath its elements, 
 that player must immediately choose any one matching 
 animal in play and suppress it.,
 
 If both sections were irrelevant, you would 
 simply discard the card with no effect.,
 Since Annelids is 
 an ongoing effect, animals played later the same round 
 by that player will also gain the benefit.,
 Give that player the 
 white pawn as a reminder of this status.,

 Legion or Line Command (LC), if he is eligible to do so [4.34 in
 combination with [4.22].,
 Charisma: Denotes his ability to spur his troops on to greater
 efforts.,
 
 DESIGN NOTE:,
 Fleeing men are
 running away from the enemy—not towards them.,
 
 If one unit has to change facing to do this, it must (and pay cohesion 
 costs to do so).,
 Phalanxes use the higher of their two MAs, so their 
 In Column MA would be ‘6’.,
 A combat unit stacked 
 with a leader may use Orderly Withdraw (6.6) together, or the leader 
 may withdraw (4.82) and the combat unit remains.,

 If all defenders are Routed, or are all Skirmisher (SK) units, the 
 attackers need not make a TQ check.,
 Knights, even
 though they do not have a “Moved” side, are affected by 6.13.Dismounted units are affected by 6.13.,
 Note
 that both units rotated before they moved adjacent because
 changing facing is normally not allowed in an EZOC (7.13).,
 This E-I Orders Phase
 may be undertaken by the OC or by any one subordinate leader who
 is in his Command Range, regardless of Initiative Rating, as
 designated by the player.,
 If either or both sides has
 a leader stacked with one of the units involved in combat the player
 rolls the die for each such leader.,
 The Direct Fire would receive a +1 for
 moving target and a +1 against Mongol LC/+2 against HC.,
 
 7.36 Galleys that conduct an Anastrophe, regardless of success,
 are automatically Fatigued.,
 
 7.22,
 PLAY NOTE:,
 Remove the “Run Aground”
 marker and Backwater one hex.,
 The game’s learning curve is moderate.,
 For this rule it is important to distinguish between 
 
 a Clan (all combat units with the same name) and the Contingent 
 
 (units with different Contingent numbers from the same clan).,
 If not, go to F.

  Busho from one contingent may not use their Orders to move 
 
 other Busho—even if that other Busho is stacked with a combat unit 
 
 that is moving; only So-Taisho can move other Busho.,
 
 
 The same applies to KB approaching KB

 the latter may not change facing

  The following units exert ZOCs:
 • All combat units exert a ZOC into their Front hexes (only),
 High 
 
 DR wins; ties roll again.,
 
 
 The  path  may  not  be  traced  through  enemy  occupied  hexes,  or 
 
 hexes in an enemy ZOC, unless the latter are occupied by friendly 
 
 units.,
 This 
 
 Samurai remains his for the remainder of the battle.,
 Despite its simplicity, this would be so 
 far from reality as to render the system—and the game—inaccurate.,
 An AM selected by Initiative (5.22) cannot be Trumped.,
 Does create some 
 interesting speculation as to what enemy reaction was to this.,
 The Egyptian 
 player rolls less than a ‘6’ for each and thus both pass the check.,
 Its 
 movement is finished for that Orders Phase.,
 These 
 include Russian Revolutions, fortress surrender, Turkish surren-

 See 13.3 for FR replacement restrictions 
 via HQ on the East Front map.,
  DRMs come from a variety of 
 sources: certain units, entrenchments, various events, concentric-
 ity, etc.,
